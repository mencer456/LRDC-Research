My major was in the food science and nutrition in junior college. If I hadn't continued my studying, I would have taken a test for dietician certificate. If I had passed the test, I could have had the dietician license. If I had become a dietician, I would have worked in a hospital. If I had worked in the hospital, I could have given people advice about the kind of food they should eat.
 In the other hand, if I hadn't changed my major to the information science and learning technology, I would have continued to study in the food science and nutrition. If I had continued to study in the food science and nutrition, I could have done more research in the food and nutrition. If I had done more research in the food and nutrition, I could have developed more healthy food. If I had developed more healthy food, I could have been an expert in the food and nutrition. If I had become an expert in this filed, I would have gained a lot of money.","My major was in the food science and nutrition in junior college.

After we checked in, we went to ""Dinner"" and had our early dinner. In the ""Dinner"", Peter taught us the names of different dressings that we hadn't known. He asked the waitress to give us four kinds of dressings and got us to remember. It was so funny, wasn't it? After finishing our dinner, we walked to the port which had fireworks show at that night. while we were waiting for the fireworks, we bought popsicles which had different shape. Mine was a Snoopy's head. Then we saw and enjoyed the show. Second day we visited the Liberty Bell, which is a famous symbol in the history of the U.S; we rode a horse cab; also we took the subway, which I had never tried in the U.s. At night, we had dinner at an Afghanistan restaurant which had exactly special food. After going back to the hotel, we had a small party which with beer and snacks.

The worse experience I have ever had with run out of money was four years ago when I first moved to Taipei. Taipei is one of big city in my country. After the first week working, I went shopping alone. It was a sunny day. First I went to a mall and bought many clothes and a lot of daily appliances. Then I went to a supermarket to buy some fruit, many cookies, and several condiments. After my shopping, I spent lots of money. So I felt I had to go home before I ran out of money. But at this moment I met a cosmetician, she promoted the sales of cosmetic. At that time, I wanted to say No, I don't need cosmetic instead of I don't know how to use them. But I didn't. So she was very enthusiastic telling me how to use all products. Finally I bought the product by paying a great of money, around $4,000 US, with my credit card. After I got home, I recognize all cosmetic cost me two and half month salary and I totally ran out of money. After this worse shopping experience, I cut my credit card. Now when I go shopping each time, I always remind myself don't ran out of money.

 University students don't have enough time to do everything they want. They want to do a lot of activities like drinking, traveling and studying, because they have unlimited energies. However, it's really difficult to deal with time for the students, because before they become university students, they usually follow the schedules of school. Now, they should manage their time themselves, because they are adults. Students who begin as an university student can manage their time well by following these advice. 
 The first thing I want to manage is to study. As you know, a student is who studies something. Studying is definitely an important time for them. In my opinion, students should study at least 2 hours except his lectures a day. This time is for reviewing the lectures. Reviewing lectures help you remember about the lectures, so you will need much less time to study when you have a test. However, studying too much isn't the best for students. There are so many valuable things you can't learn by books and studying in the world. To give an example, you can't learn how to swim by book or studying. Therefore, studying is important for students. However, studying only is not the best way for students.
 Another advice is about having fun. Students have many chances for having fun. Having fun has many positive effects. For example, students can reduce their stress by drinking, having parties and enjoying hobbies etc. Also, it helps you adapt to the society. However, some students only pursue having fun, so they never study. Even they skip lectures. Be careful to have fun. Having fun after you finish your task is ok, but before you finish your task is not ok.
 The last advice is about using time during vacation. You'll have several vacations, and the vacations will be good opportunities for you. You can improve your weaknesses or you can travel abroad or you can make some money during vacations. The point is that you should have some special experiences. Not only studying, but also having experience is important. Having experiences make you stronger so that when you have problems, you can overcome them easily. Therefore, having experiences during vacations to improve yourself is the last tip to manage time as an university student. 
 As an university student, time is very significant. Your future will be decided by this time. What kind of person you become is up to this time, so you should manage your time as well as you can. Then, I'm convinced you can become a person who you want to be. 
","University students don't have enough time to do everything they want. They want to do a lot of activities like drinking, traveling and studying, because they have unlimited energies. However, it's really difficult to deal with time for the students, because before they become university students, they usually follow the schedules of school. Now, they should manage their time themselves, because they are adults. Students who begin as an university student can manage their time well by following these advice. The first thing I want to manage is to study. As you know, a student is who studies something. Studying is definitely an important time for them. In my opinion, students should study at least 2 hours except his lectures a day. This time is for reviewing the lectures. Reviewing lectures help you remember about the lectures, so you will need much less time to study when you have a test. However, studying too much isn't the best for students. There are so many valuable things you can't learn by books and studying in the world. To give an example, you can't learn how to swim by book or studying. Therefore, studying is important for students. However, studying only is not the best way for students. Another advice is about having fun. Students have many chances for having fun. Having fun has many positive effects. For example, students can reduce their stress by drinking, having parties and enjoying hobbies etc. Also, it helps you adapt to the society.

There are so many kinds of a new computer in the shop, and each computer has their own condition and price. But the price isn't always reasonable. Too expensive is not good obviously, and too low price is also bad, maybe there are some problems with its ability or condition. So if you want to purchase a new computer, there are three important process you have to do, gathering information before go to the shop, considering the brand and calculating the whole price in the shop, to make a wise purchase.
The first step for wise purchase is gathering some information on the web site or friends who know well about computer before going to the shop. Investigate about some major companies and lowest price of each part. If you know about lowest price, even it's hard to find products with that price, it helps you to calculate whole price and compare with the shown price. There are many communities deal with computer information on the internet, so you can get many information easily. Also you can use someone's recommendation or comments that come from his experience. If you just go to the shop without these preparations, maybe you can't do anything for wise product.
When you come to the shop, consider the brand of a computer and each part when you choose. You can see the list that contains detail information. If you can't see that list or it doesn't contain details, ask to the seller about detail, especially the brand. The brand name is very important in all parts of a computer because there are so many companies who product computer or each part in the world, and many of them don't have a fine service system for customers. Furthermore, there is a quite possibility for products from those kinds of companies to have bad quality. So choosing well-known brand name will guarantee the ability of the computer, and if some problems happen, you can receive the after service easily.
After checking the brand, calculate the whole price and compare it with the shown(?) price. Sum up all lowest price of each part, which already you know. Maybe it's not exactly same, but if the gap is abnormally large, it's better for you to consider another one. In case of finished product, the gap is usually large, so it's up to you finding proper price as the successful ending of the wise purchase.
 Because the computer is a expensive product, and we usually use this thing for a long time, the process for the goal may be complicated. But this process deserves to take hard efforts, and even though it takes long time for preparation, it will compensate you by providing reasonable quality.

There are the cultural expectations of success for females. It means if a female can do as much to assist a male, she is regarded as a successful woman. 
Moreover, it is important to a woman gets marry than to have a high education or good position. When she gets married to someone, the elder members of her family would consider her marrying a rich man who has houses, cars, higher education and can make a lot of money. For example, I was born in a conservative and traditional family. When I was 25 years old, I got a master's degree. Besides my parents, all of the elder members at my family thought I was eligible for marriage. They wanted me to marry an eligible man they liked. I rejected this idea and got a good position in my country. Although I think I am successful in my life so far, the elder members of my family do not agree with me.

Playing computer online games is a trend that is becoming more and more popular through the world. Playing computer online games is interesting. It seems like a real world, there are many people (users), vehicles, money and occupations. Some people enjoy a computer online game, and they may feel excited, because it's like a real world. Also, they can experience another life in a computer online game. They can have a different job, and experience something that they can't do in their real lives. For instance, flying in the sky, killing somebody and being a thief are something they can't usually do in their real lives. That's why many people are enthusiastic about playing computer online games. However, as much as playing computer online games is popular, there are some side effects in the online games' world like game addiction and merchandising cyber money.

 One side effect of playing computer online games is addiction of playing them. Some people play online games too much. They don't even do what they have to do, like working and studying. Playing computer online games too much sometimes causes chronic fatigue and affects users' lives badly, because some online game users never stop playing them. For example, according to an article, a student who was addicted to playing the World of Warcraft, which is one of the most popular online games, said, ""I would go on at 5 p.m., sign off at 5 a.m., sleep for a couple of hours, go to class, then play again."" Also, ""My GPA dropped to a 2.9,"" the student said (ANON_NAME_0, 2007). In addition, a Chinese person died while he was playing a computer online game in China. As I mentioned, playing computer online games too much may affect the users' lives.

 Another side effect of playing computer online games is merchandising cyber money. Cyber money is money that online game users can use on the online games. It's not real money. Online game users can buy some items they need or want by using cyber money. While users play an online game, they can make some cyber money by selling some items that they got during the game. There are some rare items in an online game, and the rare items are really expensive in the cyber money, so some users want to get the rare items by paying real money. Thus, some users who sell rare items can make real money. It lets users spend more time on playing online games, because they may make real money. Then, spending more time playing online games creates addicts. Therefore, merchandising cyber money can cause addiction to playing online games.

 In sum, playing computer online games is an interesting hobby, if people enjoy it properly. It helps people experience a cyber world that is different from real life. However, as playing computer online games becomes popular, some side effects appear, like addiction to playing it and merchandising cyber money. Therefore, people who are interested in playing computer online game should recognize these side effects and be prepared for them.

 A feedlot, also known as a type of ""Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO)"", is an intensive way for feeding beef cattle. Beef livestock are arrayed in pens (small enclosures for domestic animals) after spending their first 2-3 years grazing on rangelands (Feedlot, 2007). Although, the needed investment for a regular Feedlot is higher, the time for selling the animals is shorter, and it is the manager's knowledge and experience about spending less and earning more, which determines how profitable is the business.
 A selected animal for a feedlot must weigh about 650 pounds. Once in the feedlot, an animal should gain an extra 400 pounds between 3-4 months. This 400 pounds consists mostly from fat, but it also provides more ""juiciness"" in the final product. 
 The structure of Feedlots consists of small enclosures, built close together and well distributed for everyday management. Daily, the cattle is fed with a diet made up of hay, corn, sorghum, various other grains, by-products of food processing, such as sugar beet waste, molasses, soybean meal, or cottonseed meal, and minerals (Feedlot, 2007). 
 Nowadays, feedlots are the most advanced technique for producing beef meat. These agricultural businessmen invest the biggest part of their budget in feeding instead of space in order to achieve a resulting product in half the time or even sooner as in traditional cattle farms.
 However, minimizing the time of production has some complicated consequences. The amount of manure is higher than in any other business, and if it's not managed properly, pollution can easily result. Therefore several regulations have been created to ensure a construction of a feedlot capable of preserving the environment (Controlling Runoff for Livestock Feedlots, 1981). 
 An example of this field of business is the Harris Feeding Company (Harris Ranch Feedlot, 2006), which noticed a production of 250,000 head of beef cattle per year in an area of 800 acres. It is considered the largest fully integrated beef operation in California with a production of 150 million pounds of beef making.
 The main reason for the success of this company is the organization. Research is essential for this kind of business before choosing materials, designing the blueprints and, naturally, creating the best diet for the cattle. After the decisions are made, the budget should indicate low costs and high quality. In other words, spending wisely will create more profit.","A feedlot, also known as a type of ""Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO)"", is an intensive way for feeding beef cattle.

When you are planning a trip you need to have some ideas and decide what you want for this trip. I think the most important part when you are planning a trip is to find a place that is exciting and beautiful with the beaches, great hotels and a lot of night places. You can look at the internet for these places because there are a few ANON_NAME_0 where you can look for this paradise or you can go to the travel agency and they can give you some recommendations about what you want. Another way to find a place is to talk with your friends about their experience or ask them if they know some places that you are looking for. Then you can choose the island or city that you want, for example with white sand beach, different colors when you see the ocean, wonderful hotels and exciting night life. When you find the tropical paradise you can choose the people who will join you for this trip. If you want a love trip on an exotic island you only need one person, someone who increases your heart rate, someone who one second with her it's enough for the rest of your life, someone who shares with you your dreams, your love and your fantasies. Obviously, this person is not easy to find. This kind of trip you can share with the woman who you love if she wants to enjoy a magnificent adventure. On the other hand, if you want a crazy trip, the best companies are your best friends. You can share with them all your adventures, drink until you can find more liquor, eat every day all day, go to the night clubs and try to make and approach with girls, and when you have time take a rest or perhaps do some sports.

There also have different kinds of ways to sing by music. One is teenagers' favorite: pop music. Some of them like rock music, others like R&B, and others like RAP. People who like rock music have two choices. First is heavy metal. This kind of music could make you deaf, because it's loud and noise. If you don't like heavy metal, you have another choice. You can try light metal. This is much more comfortable for our ears to listen to. I like light metal the most, but when I feel depressed, I'll listen to heavy metal to express my feelings. Another kind of music is classical music, which is musicians' favorite. People are familiar with Bach and Beethoven the most, especially Beethoven. He's the most popular musician. Sometimes listen to classical music can help us relax. For the people who have insomnia, it might be more helpful than taking medicine. The other music production is drama, in which actors need to sing and act. Mei's Shadow of The Opera and Cats are famous by people. Almost everyone in the world knows these two dramas. Even if they never see any one of them, they might have heard the song from the show. I never wanted to see a drama, but after I saw Cats advertisement, it really got me interested.

 Woman's role in this society has changed dramatically in the last century. 100 years ago, most women were only housewives. Their life's goals included staying at home all day, doing house chores, having a large family, and raising the children. However, in most countries today, many women not only perform very well in their education and occupation, they also share the same responsibilities as men.
 Many women today have a very high level of education. Most women today have at least university degrees, and some even have Master's degrees or Doctor's degrees. They have degrees in many difficult fields, such as engineering, computer, astronomy, and medicine. Families today think that not only their sons but their daughters need to go to school. 100 years ago, it was not easy for women to receive degrees. For example, my great grandmother never went to any school. My grandmother only went to elementary school. In her generation, it was not easy to go to school, especially for women. In old traditional Chinese ideas, women didn't need to accept education. They have to go to work and earn money for their parents and brothers who can go to schools. Unlike them, my mother, my older sister and I both have a university degree. My older sister had a Master's degree in England's university last year. I am also interested in a Master's degree in the future after I finish ELI.
 Many women today also have very high paying occupations. There are women in many kinds of professions. Many big companies have female businesswomen. For example, eBay's CEO, Meg Whitman, is a woman. Many doctors, engineers and astronomers in science today are also female. A lot of women have also become influential politicians in many countries. Hillary Clinton was a famous first lady when Bill Clinton was president. Now she is a candidate for president in the next election. This is very different from 100 years ago, when most women stayed at home to cook and raise children.
 Women today share the same responsibilities as men. Many husbands and wives today share house work at home. Some husbands sometimes even cook for the family. Today's women also work hard to earn money for their families. After I get married to my boyfriend in the future, I will share the same responsibilities with him.

And the woman lawyer Mi-Ae Kim is working as lawyer who solves problems relating to social problem. This facts show us that the occupations such as a doctor and lawyer are not just for men.

They can get a lot of money, as well as finish housework quickly. Despite discrimination between men and women in the past, women have recovered a right in Korea. In summary, women have contributed in many areas of society. We should not have prejudice that women have to do housework. We also should think that women and men are equal. In the future, more women will take part in many fields of society.",3,Not 3lang

The most influential language in the world is English . I've been learning English, since I was child. Many countries and people spend a lot of time studying English. By knowing Englsih, we can get many benefits in various ways, such as for study,job,life in the US.

It can be so helpful for me wherever I study.

After we grauate school, we'll have a job. My friend who came from Saudi Arabia said ""I have to have good ability to communicate with foriegners and my company wants that. That's why I came here."" I came to know more detail that some people learn english for own job through him. If we have a job in here, it's more important to learn english because most people who live in here use English.

 My Friends in my Church live in Pittsburgh. Although they already know english a little bit, 
they want to learn english more for their better life. It's not about study or job. When we do so important things such as contract or purchase, 
english is necessary for us. For a time, my freind injured but it was very hard to explain his pain to doctor because of our poor english. At that time, we felt the important of knowing English.

Do you want to know what the reaction is when Chinese women find out the sex of their new born baby girl? 50 years ago, they might have felt self condemned, disappointed and cried. But now, most Chinese women feel happy and excited. Why are there so different attitudes between the past and now? Because the role of Chinese women have changed from dependent to independent through education, economy and events.
Education makes women have consciousness and the ability to be independent. 50 years ago, girls were thought of as housewives all their lifetime in China, so education was unnecessary to them. Now, there is an important policy: every child has the right to go to school. From the education they received, they realize they are individuate and learn some skills, such as writing, counting, medicine. These make them stand on their own feet.
Most Chinese women not only take care of their family but also support their family outcome make them have higher position in their family than last. .50 years ago, many Chinese women like my grandmother couldn't earn money by themselves, so they had to dependent on their husbands. Most of them didn't have the right to decide important things in a family, some of them didn't even have the right to eat with their husbands at the dinner table at the same time. Now, women can work outside and get the same pay as men. They can decide how to spend the money, also they can plan the future of their family with their husbands. Because they have their income, they have the equal position with their spouses in a family.
Not just in family, in many social events women also are the main roles. For example, WuYi as the vice premier of China can decide many events of economy and has huge influence on china. Many people think she is a strong woman on negonation table. Many women join social events and participate in election to strive for women's rights or help more people. It was impossible for most of the women 50 years ago.
From housewife to intelligentsia, career women and social actioner, from dependent to independent, women will become a more and more important part of our society.

Pensylvania discussed a law against sexual discrimination, which was proposed by Dan Frankel, representative of Pensylvania's Human Relations Act. This law would offer protection to gay, lesbian and transgender citizens in order to avoid limitations to find a job, house and have a free social life. In addition, this law would recognize to people with diverse life styles and would do that Pensylvania and Pittsburgh will be more attractive to those graduated who wish to find a job, with legal protection and without social marginalization due to their sexual condition. Therefore, Frankel thinks that the law will approve and will be very helpful for these people.","Pensylvania discussed a law against sexual discrimination, which was proposed by Dan Frankel, representative of Pensylvania's Human Relations Act.

I think that learn English is the most important reason because if I want to do more things here, the communication is the most important thing. And why did I choose the US? Well, this is because I'm from Mexico and is easier for me to move here than other country.

My second reason to live here is to study in a good university. The United States has the best universities in the world like Harvard, Stanford, University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon and more. I want to study in a university from the US because the education is better than in my country and I can be more prepared, so I can find a better job. But, sometimes for foreign students study here is too expensive. In this case, you can get a scholarship (if you are an excellent student) and it's easier to pay the expenses. 

My last reason to live in the US is to get a good job because I learned English and studied in a good university. I prefer to work in the US rather than in Mexico because the salary is better paid in the United States. Also the economy is stronger and I can gain in dollars. 

These are only a few reasons I have to live in the United States but can have more, although sometimes it's difficult to be far of your family or your friends. I know that if you do an effort to be more prepared you will have more success in the life.

 Traditional Chinese instruments have been around for thousands of generations during more than 5000 years of Chinese history. Chinese instruments were used for Traditional Chinese orchestra performances, theater, opera, and other musical activities. In the modern Chinese society, the rise of Western instruments such as piano and violin caused some decline in people's interest in Chinese instruments. About 20 years ago in the 1980's, several city governments in Taiwan decided to provide money to raise the interest once again. The city governments' actions 20 years ago had 3 main effects; including forming several music schools, nurturing talented music students in challenging competitions, and reviving people's interest in Chinese music today.
 Before 1988, there were already students studying Chinese instruments in elementary school. However, there were not many students. The city government of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, my hometown, started to spend money and consequently, formed a school called Experimental Music School for Chinese Music. The government was not sure how people would react to the formation of this school, therefore they called this experimental music school. Not only my school was formed, but several other schools also followed because people's interest was high. I was one of the first students to join in this experimental school for Chinese music.
 As a result of the formation of the schools, the schools started to hire Chinese musical instrument teachers and recruit and nurture students. The students applied to the schools, took an IQ exam, and performed an instrument of their, usually piano or violin. Students performed piano or violin because they were common and basic instruments that most students already knew how to play, especially piano. Piano is the instrument that includes a lot of basic knowledge and skills of music. Also it would be really helpful if students had already known how to play piano. Students were recruited based on their IQ exam scores and music abilities. They then learned to play different Chinese instruments. The instrument I played was called Pi-Pa. Pi-Pa is a string instrument with 4 strings. It is equivalent to the guitar, but they still have many differences. It is played using nails attached to fingers. After years of practice, I competed in individual competitions and won championships several times in Taiwan because of my hard work. Students also formed Chinese orchestras and performed in city and then national competitions. In 1992, my school orchestra won the championship in all of Taiwan, as a consequence of our teachers' great teaching and our excellent team work.
 The city governments' investment 20 years ago has also revived the interest in Chinese music for Taiwanese people today. People in Taiwan now think learning Chinese instrument is as important as learning Western instruments. If someone can play a Chinese instrument, it is actually a very special thing, due to so many people playing piano or violin. Talented Chinese musicians now perform in many concerts, both solo and in orchestras. Chinese music is now a large part of Taiwanese culture.
20 years ago, experimental schools for Chinese music were first formed. Today, there are many more elementary schools, junior high schools, senior high schools, and even universities that have Chinese orchestras. Because of the rising number of students who decide to learn Chinese instruments, every year there is a lot of competitions for different levels, from elementary school to university. Just like China, there are many talented Chinese instrument players in Taiwan now. The government did a very wonderful job and now Chinese music is a very important part of Taiwanese culture.

It was very difficult for me to read books and take examinations. I sometimes gave up a course I attended because I could not read English books well, and I even lost interest in my major because of English. At that time, I realized that English is a very important thing for me. That is why I decided to learn English in the U.S. I could select from many cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, etc. However, I decided to study English in Pittsburgh. There are three main reasons why I decided to learn English in Pittsburgh: the rate of Korean students, prices, and the environment in Pittsburgh
The first reason I decided to learn English in Pittsburgh is the rate of Korean students. There are few Korean students in Pittsburgh unlike other cities. Before I came to Pittsburgh, I thought that the rate of Korean students was crucial for learning English. If there are many Korean students in city, people who go to that city have fewer opportunities to speak English. For example, in Los Angeles Koreans don't have to speak English because there are many Koreans in Los Angeles and Korean shops. This fact means that it is hard to talk with native speakers in Los Angeles. On the other hand, since there are few Koreans in Pittsburgh, Koreans have to speak English to communicate with native speakers when they want to buy something in the market and ask questions to other people.
Another reason I decided to learn English in Pittsburgh is prices. The prices in Pittsburgh are very cheap compared with other cities. For instance, in New York, Mcdonald Big Mac Hamburger's meal price is about $7, but in Pittsburgh, the hamburger's meal price is about $5. And the housing price is cheap as well. Even the housing price is much cheaper than in Korea. I can save money while I am studying English.
The last reason I decided to learn English in Pittsburgh is the environment. First of all, Pittsburgh is very safe. If people live in a dangerous place, they might always be nervous whenever they come back home. And Pittsburgh also has a good surrounding for studying. There are few playing places around university such as pubs, bars, karaoke, etc, so the students can concentrate only for studying. The University of Pittsburgh has good libraries and museums as well. These surroundings inspire students to study very hard. Furthermore, the public transportation is convenient, and the main places such as universities, downtown, museums, and parks have bus stops and subway stations. People who live in Pittsburgh can go anywhere. 
Due to these three reasons, I selected Pittsburgh to study English. I believe that Pittsburgh is a best city for students who want to study English. After I learn English in Pittsburgh, I will be able to read English books and take English lectures well. That is why I would be able to get good grades and a job after graduation. Also, my dream is to be a banker who deals with foreign customers. Therefore, the experience that I learn English in Pittsburgh would be the most important experience for my dream.
","In Korea, when I was a freshman in my university, a majority of examinations and books are written in English. It was very difficult for me to read books and take examinations. I sometimes gave up a course I attended because I could not read English books well, and I even lost interest in my major because of English. At that time, I realized that English is a very important thing for me. That is why I decided to learn English in the U.S. I could select from many cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, etc. However, I decided to study English in Pittsburgh.

Today, personal appearance is important to meet people and we can't find overweight women in Korea. The thin people have many chances about meet people, because they look charming.

For most Chinese who are not teachers, teaching is a good job now because the salary of teachers have increased quickly since 2004, and there are a total 3- month vacation with pay every year. However, when you talk with teachers, you can find more and more teachers want to quit their jobs and think they are very unhappy and feel large stress in their jobs. There are 3 main reasons in China why more and more teachers want to quit their jobs, including: the stress of the job, the attitude of students and their parents to teachers and the public opinion about teachers.
Teachers feel stress due to the heavy work, the stress of students' grades and the long work time. In China, the number of students a teacher teach are too many, usually 110 to 140 students per teacher. As a result, teachers not only need to prepare class, teach class, study new knowledge and improve the skills of teaching, but also need to spend a lot of time to correct homework, solve the problems of students and meet some students' parents. On the other hand, a teacher's salary and reputation directed relate to the grade of their students. As a teacher, you must be skillful and have to do all you can to have your students gotten a good grade. However, it's not enough because the competition between students is so intense in China, and most students have to study from 7:30am to 9:30pm. In other words, the work time of a teacher will be longer than it. It's really a busy and stressful day.
Another important reason leading to teachers want to requite is the attitude of students and their parents to teachers. Many students don't respect their teachers and more and more conflict accidents between teachers and students have been reported by the media. The most dire example is a high school student who killed his teacher just because the teacher always takes away his novel in class. It makes many teachers afraid of supervising their students. Some parents don't cooperate with teachers to teach their children. They think teaching kids is the duty of teachers or they don't want to blame their children because they dote on their children.
The Public opinion about teachers is also unjust. Many people think all teachers only want to earn money because some teachers set up remedial classes. They think students' quality gets worse just because the teacher didn't give a good instruction. If teachers manage their students loosely, they criticize teachers for not having responsibility. On the other hand, if teachers manage their students strictly and cause conflict with students, they criticize teachers for punishing students at first.
From the above reasons, one can see that it's really hard for teachers in China. I think education is the duty of teachers, parents and society, not just teachers. Also the work is heavy and the work time is long like now. If we give teachers more understand and less blame, our education will get better and teachers will love their jobs.

 Many students decide to study in the U.S. for their short term and long term goals. In spite of the expensive educational expenses, students are changing their direction to the U.S. Since the U.S. offers quite good chances to improve their skills.
It could be for learning the language, culture, to apply for undergraduate and graduate school that will connect to their career or for any reasons. Likewise, I am in the U.S. to learn English. There are several reasons I decided to learn English in the United States, including the fact that the U.S. is an English-speaking country, it can further my education and my career.

The U.S. is an English-speaking country, which offers me a better environment to learn English than my country. Actually, it is possible to study English in my country, but it takes a lot of time to cause good results in English skills because it is short of good environment. It is not easy to study English in a country in which I speak, write, read and hear in Korean everyday. I learned English in middle and high school. However, it was difficult to see that my skill got better. I think one of the reasons was that I spend the rest of my time in Korean. It was not easy to change my brain to think English which is really important. I had experience in that, when I spoke German for 10 years.
On the other hand, in the U.S., it is possible to learn English as well as the culture in a natural way. I can try to think in English because my life is almost all in English. All classes are in English that will upgrade my skills easier. The teachers are upgrading not only my English skills but also my knowledge about the U.S. culture, which will help further my education.

 Another reason is for my education. Many foreign students decided to study management in the U.S. , because the U.S. has a very good system to learn management. After I am better in academic English skills, it will help me to go to a graduate school to learn management in the U.S. If I study management in the U.S., it will effect an advantage to get in a company. It might help to get a better position and more chances in promotion. When I study MBA in the U.S. as well as the education system, it is recognized in our country. Moreover, The MBA will help me to make relationships with people all over the world. The students who I am going to study with could be grow up in a very high position. These will certainly help my career.

The last reason is to work in a global company that offers me a better chance to work with companies all over the world. I am not sure to talk about my future because it doesn't exist now. But my plan is to work in a company that has many relationships with companies as well as people. It could be a Korean company or a U.S. company. For example, my company named '3ksoftware' will establish a company here in Pittsburgh. It is working now with the CMU together. My company invented a program that might change many things on internet, and the CMU is very interested on this program. Moreover, my company will work in few months with the Booing company to check this new system. After many years, it will work not only with U.S. companies but also with companies all over the world. However, the problem is that only few people are prepared to deal with international companies. I might work in my company and prove my skills because I am prepared in English as well as management. Finally, I want to to be a professional in my area. 

For these reasons, I decided to learn English in the U.S. It is my first step to further my career. Moreover, it will further my relationship with people all over the world that started already when I made my first step in the U.S. . The U.S. offers me the best environment to think global and act global. And then I will be ready to be a necessary person in the future.

I am not sure to talk about my future because it doesn't exist now. But my plan is to work in a company that has many relationships with companies as well as people. It could be a Korean company or a U.S. company. For example, my company named '3ksoftware' will establish a company here in Pittsburgh. It is working now with the CMU together. My company invented a program that might change many things on internet, and the CMU is very interested on this program. Moreover, my company will work in few months with the Booing company to check this new system. After many years, it will work not only with U.S. companies but also with companies all over the world. However, the problem is that only few people are prepared to deal with international companies. I might work in my company and prove my skills because I am prepared in English as well as management. Finally, I want to to be a professional in my area. For these reasons, I decided to learn English in the U.S. It is my first step to further my career. Moreover, it will further my relationship with people all over the world that started already when I made my first step in the U.S. The U.S. offers me the best environment to think global and act global. And then I will be ready to be a necessary person in the future. ",3,Not 3lang

But the important thing is how to make them become successful person. Though students can be grouped into three types: genius, hard-working and having no attitude on study at all.

Most students are envy genius students, because they can easily understand what the teacher just taught about, even though they do not need to practice. But genius students are hardly to find. Some genius students can remember sentences or a lecture after they just read it, and can memorize it forever. It is impossible for us who need to look over for at least two or three times to remember them all, and probably will forget them after three or four days. Most of the genius students can have a splendid future, if they keep using their innate intelligent.

The second group of students is hard-working students. This is the most common students in the world we have. They like to ask questions once they have problems. They like to learn new knowledge even though it is not from textbooks. They will preview textbooks before classes, and review them after classes. They also will spend time on practicing skills they just learned. Everyone likes hard-working students, especially for teachers. Because they do not need to worry about whether they have questions or have problems on their study. They will ask immediately once they cannot figure out how to solve them.

The last group of students is the students who have no attitude on study at all. They do not pay attention in class, they just want to play. They do not like to read books, except comic books or magazines. They always think of what are the most interesting games that people are playing now, should they buy them? Or how do they download them. They never try to learn when they were at school. And most of them become criminals, and have some dreadful behavior.

Although there are many kinds of students in a country, a town, it is not nice for teachers to separate students into groups, only take care of genius students and hard-working students, and cast away the students who have no attitude on study. Though they do not like to study, some of them still have a nice personality, Groups are not important; the most important is how to let them have an out-standing future.","The kinds of students are variety.

 The main purpose of going to the hospital is seeing doctors for diagnosis and treatment, therefore patients tend to think that only the doctors they meet in medical offices are real doctors. However, there are a lot of doctors who are involving in medical care and patients can not meet them in the hospital, but their contribution is not less than the others whom patients meet in the hospital. Therefore the doctors can be grouped into three types according to their specific fields; we can find out the doctor's job in more detail.
 The first group includes the doctors who are working in the fields of bioscience. They don't meet patients and even are not actually working in the hospital, but their job is very essential in the modern medical services. They are studying basic science in the laboratory and proclaiming the new theories in their fields, such as anatomy, physiology, organic chemistry, pharmacology, and genetic engineering. These findings are supporting the current medical issues and also leading the directions the medical care should follow. 
 The second group is the most familiar doctors whom the patients meet in the hospital (I'll call them primary clinicians.). They contact their patients directly; they check up the patients, and manage all about diagnosis and treatment. We also divide them into departments according to the specialties, like internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, and so on. They need to get training for seeing patients, and have responsibilities for the patients' lives as the first group does. 
 The last group is invisible to the patients but exists in the hospital - very close to the patients. They contribute to the diagnosis especially; for instance, diagnostic/anatomic pathology, and radiology. Even though they do not contact the patients directly, they look over the patients in detail and often discuss with the primary clinicians about their patients behind the scenes.
 There are actors, directors, writers and technicians in making a film, and we don't say that the film is successful only because of the actors. Like that, a patient has a lot of doctors, whom the patient can not recognize, but who are involved in the patient's work up. They are also doctors who care for the patients, and have contributed to their medical care.

What is a student? I can give many categories of student definition.
A student is somebody who is studying at school. Or a student is a child who is studying at a secondary school. Someone who is a student of a particular subject is interested in the subject and spends time for learning about it. The types of students have different meaning. 

First of all, we can call them different words such as, 'young people', 'leaner', 'pupil'. Young people are under age 13 to 28. And we can call them 'learner'. That's when they have duty to study and they have many exams for their grade evaluation. Therefore they have to learn to study. They spend all time for learning at school. Some people call them 'pupil', because, that means they are not young but not yet adult. They are elementary, middle, high school people or special study people, such as tutor of the artiste world.

Second of all, their sentiment is very abundant. They are very curiosity, inquisitive and interest. I think that their emotion at first is out of curiosity. Also they take a fresh interest in life from friendship. And they enjoy learning new things. Such as sports, meet new people and their study. They find interested in their major.

Finally, they are full of competitive spirit. Such as, students who work hard get better grades than students who don't. They compete with each other for the grade or examination. They make every effort for everything such as, studying or to playing. They are concerned to do everything. Also they should make effort to make progress for their future. 

My point is that all people had have be a student. Everyone goes through the experience of becoming a student. Student's problems or their situations are basically problems that all young people have as they grow up. They have many ambitions for their future.
","What is a student? I can give many categories of student definition. A student is somebody who is studying at school. Or a student is a child who is studying at a secondary school. Someone who is a student of a particular subject is interested in the subject and spends time for learning about it. The types of students have different meaning. First of all, we can call them different words such as, 'young people', 'leaner', 'pupil'. Young people are under age 13 to 28. And we can call them 'learner'. That's when they have duty to study and they have many exams for their grade evaluation. Therefore they have to learn to study. They spend all time for learning at school.

Bad habits engross a large number of items like heavy drinking, swearing, indecency, arguing, overeating, spitefulness, abuse, malice, smoking, cheating, bad smells, etc. More of these bad habits can be normal in different societies, for this reason sometimes are very difficult to explain because someone can be interpreted in different way these concepts. In many cases more of these items can have a relationship between them; for example : A woman who suffer abuse, her husband probably is an alcoholic, use tobacco or any kind of drugs or has another woman. In this article I write about the four items that I think are the most important topics to develop in bad habits comportment like abuse, infidelity, smoking and alcoholism. 

The first topic that I want to develop is abuse. Domestic abuse between spouses or partners is when one person in the relationship tries to control the other person. The victim of domestic abuse or physical abuse can be a man or a woman. The person who produces the abuse can use intimidation, humiliation, mortification, degradation, deprivation or sometimes physical injury. There are a lot of types of abuse like physical abuse, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, financial abuse, spiritual abuse or stalking. Despite of every item is very important, I think the most dangerous abuse is physical abuse because a lot of women die for this reason; for example, in the United States more than three thousand women die per year. Different types of physical abuse are pushing, hitting, beating, kicking, assault with a weapons, burning, etc. I don't know where or when this problem started but one of the hypotheses is what the person who commitment the abuse could be suffered abuse or grew up in a family where existed abuse or sometimes this person doesn't have history about abuse.

The second important topic about bad habits is infidelity or cheating. Lot countries like Colombia, United States or Mexico have an increase in the number of divorce due to infidelity. The number and statistic about this produce scare; for example: 17% of divorces in the United States are caused by infidelity, 22% of married men and 14% of married women have had affairs at least once during their married lives and up to 37% of men and 22% of women admit to have affairs. What it means? Why is the cause of infidelity? Or why you are looking another woman or man if you have everything in your home? These are very difficult questions to answer because if you ask to someone why he or she do this, probably you find a lot of different answers, like I don't know, I have a lot of temptations, I am boring in my relationship; it is the human being nature or only for placer. The infidelity increases day by day and probably we don't have nothing to do to avoid this.

The third but no least important topic is smoking or tobacco use. The purpose of this article is not to write about the effects that the tobacco produce in your health like heart disease, lung disease or how many people die per year for causes of tobacco, it is about the bad habit to smoke. The smoker smells bad, his clothes smells terrible, his teeth change the white color to yellow color. Everybody around the smoker feels that they can smoke too because they are passive smokers inhaling the smoke, at meantime when you go to a close place like a bar your clothes and everything smells like a cigarette. This bad habit is accepted socially because the industries of cigarettes have a lot of power and expend a lot of money in publicity as a result they need to recover this money. I think the anti-smokers laws needs to change to protect everybody who don't smoke 

The last point is alcoholism. This point is very crucial because the alcohol involve much harm; for example, it is very dangerous to the community when someone drive under alcohol influence, he is at risk to suffer an accident or produce an accident, kill people and destroy propriety like his cars, other cars, houses, etc. Other problems are the relation about alcohol, abuse, tobacco and infidelity. Most of the abusers are under influence of alcohol, they can not control themselves and their impulses, and therefore this is a huge trouble for the people around them. They combine alcohol with tobacco or sometimes with other drugs, they change their comportment and start to look someone to commit infidelity and probably finish with an accident or abuse. This is why in this moment around the world are a lot of campaigns against alcohol, to try to reduce accidents, dead, abuse and destruction.

In conclusion, bad habits like abuse, infidelity, smoking tobacco or alcoholism are a great world dilemma and that items need to control as soon as possible to avoid more troubles and create a better place to live for everybody.

Nowadays, there are many fast food restaurants around our lives. They seem to become part of our culture years ago. Many people rely on them, not only it served fast, but also it is tasty. People can hardly live without them now. There are several causes and effects when fast food restaurants came out. 

In the past, because women did not need to go to work, they had more time to prepare the food. But now, in modern life, people seem do not have enough time. Many women go to work now. They need to work all day long, and when they go back to their home, sometimes they do not have enough energy to cook for dinner. Than, fast food become a wonderful choice if they do not want to cook. Fast food restaurants served food quickly, so they do not need to wait for a long time for their food. That's why they called ""fast food"" restaurants.

When the first fast food restaurant appeared, it just sold fast food. Now there are too many similar restaurants in our neighborhood, how do they survive between their competitive? They turned out to have children's choice. They gave toys when they ordered children's food. And those toys are popular in the time. It seems to be a wonderful option if there were children in your family. Other family members can eat food while their children play toys.

Although fast food restaurants served food faster and can have some fun with it, if we ate them too often, it is not a positive choice for our health. Many fast food restaurants use a lot of oil to cook, and most of the foods are meat. If we ate too much, we might have high blood pressure.

There are several causes and effects when fast food restaurants came out. In the past, because women did not need to go to work, they had more time to prepare the food. But now, in modern life, people seem do not have enough time. Many women go to work now. They need to work all day long, and when they go back to their home, sometimes they do not have enough energy to cook for dinner.

Instead of preparing food in the house they started working in the companies and they needed something to do their role. Also everybody worked hard and fast, and the time to eat was considered not enjoying but wasting time. For the suppliers, the time was a chance to create new market. Because of development of agriculture and technology of preservation, they could get the cheap meat and vegetables easily and the cheap labors, too.

 People haven't caught the problems of fast food for longer than 40 years. They just thought that the fast food was convenient and developed form of food.

Pittsburgh and Seoul have several differences such as transportation, weather, buildings. Now, I will compare my hometown with Pittsburgh. 

 First, Seoul's transportation is different from Pittsburgh's one. Seoul is too complex city, and big city such as New York. Also, transportation complicate more than Pittsburgh's one. Seoul have many subway lanes, so foreigner often lose the way or they can't find their destination easily. But Pittsburgh's citizen use rarely subway. Seoul has many buses and bus system is much developed. Also, here has many buses and many people use bus, but I think Seoul's bus is more than Pittsburgh's one.

 Second, Seoul's buildings are different from Pittsburgh's buildings. Seoul has much high buildings, and much apartments. Especially, Seoul has high population and is not enough space, so there is much apartments over 15th. Pittsburgh's buildings is not much high except downtown, almost all buildings and apartments are not high, so I can see sky clearly in here, but Seoul is blocked by high buildings.

 Third, Seoul's weather is different from Pittsburgh's weather. In summer, Seoul too much rains, and humid. I don't like this weather, because I have much sweat. So uncomfortable degree is much high, and Seoul's rate of crime goes up. Pittsburgh's weather is wet, so clothes are dried easily. And here's weather is changeable, so our feeling is changed easily.

This is the question that everybody does. How to live a happy life? The answer is very difficult because the meaning of happy life is different for each person. For example for me, the most important items to find how to live a happy life is my family, my friends and everyone that I love have good health. On the other side, probably for the other people, they have a happy life if they have a great job and a lot of money to buy a car or a big house. This is why is very difficult to explain, but I explain why these three items are the most important way to have a happy life.

First, the family plays the most important role in this process. I have a very great family. I have my father and my brother, but I have uncles and cousins too. It is impossible for me to image the life without them because they are all in my life. They support me, give me their love, their friendship and obviously the happiness that I need. I think when someone grow in a home with happiness, love, rules and friendship like where I grew, this person have the base to built a happy life.

Second, best friends and friends play other important role to have a happy life. Why I write best friends and friends? The best friend is someone who always is there, who listen me, who gives me an advice and share with me the most important events in my life. A friend is someone who shares with me other moments like parties, dinners, trips, but I can talk with them when I want. Both are very important, sometimes the roles change, but don't matter what both always are my friends. I share with my friends everything and they are the complement that I need when my family is not there to life a happy life.

Third and not least important item is health. This item involve the others, because probably when I have a disease I can live with that but when my family or my friends are sick this is very difficult to understand. For example, when my father had a myocardial infarction, which was one of the worse events in my life. This is why, when my family and my friends have a great health, don't have any disease and are very happy, my life is great and I can support everything. 

In conclusion, for me the best way to live a happy life is simple, only need to have a wonderful family, great friends and all of them having excellent health.","This is the question that everybody does.

 Fast food restaurants today are the most popular restaurants around the world. There is a description from the newspapers ""In average, each person in the United States has fast food two to three times in one week."" To me, the main causes of the popularity of fast food restaurants are convenience, advertisement, and no change. 
 First of all, people work hard and too busy to have a good time for meal today. Therefore, fast food is convenient, easy, and save time to them. They don't need to wait for a long line and get full immediately. For my self for example, last time I went to a famous Japanese restaurant near my school to enjoy the lunch in the afternoon. However, I needed to wait in line for 10 minutes and then wait more than 30 minutes for my food is prepared. Finally, I had to hurry to eat my lunch because there was only 10 minutes and I had to go back to school. That really wasted my time and I usually only need to wait for 10 minutes in the McDonald's for my meal. 
 Second, people can have the same food in the same fast food restaurant chains all over the world. We don't have to worry about that which burger is good or not because we already tasted this kind before. Since we don't need to choose, we can enjoy my most favorite food everyday and everywhere. That really attracts customers to buy day and day.
 Last but not least, the advertisements of fast food restaurants which show fashion and happy make deep image to people. We can identify the remarkable yellow mark 1 mile away and everyone is familiar with ""I'm loving in"". Children always ask their parents to go to fast food restaurants as rewards and families can enjoy a good time in there. Consequently, fast food restaurants become more and more popular and the other fashion mark. 
 In conclusion, the popularity of fast food restaurants become more and more today. The convenience, the same food, and good advertisement make fast food get ahead and people all like them.","Fast food restaurants today are the most popular restaurants around the world.

Living in a foreign country is usually a difficult thing . In the September 11, 2006, I left my hometown, Taipei, Taiwan and came to the United States for studying English. Taipei and Pittsburgh are two cities that there are different and similar in some ways, such as the weather, the transportation and the food.

In Taipei, the weather is usually warm and sunny. Especially in Summer, on July and August, it is always as very hot as Pittsburgh. However, Taipei's winter is not so cold and usually warm like spring. On the other hand, the winter of Pittsburgh is so cold and often snowing.

Before I came to the United States, I went to work every day by subway. The transportation system is very fast and convenient in Taipei. In contrast, I usually take bus to school in Pittsburgh. There is only a short distance subway in downtown Pittsburgh. Sometimes I was late to school because I missed bus or the bus out of the time schedule. 

I usually bought food outside anytime and anywhere I wanted in Taipei. I could find any food that I wanted to eat easily. This is very different from what I usually do in Pittsburgh. Unlike Taipei, I can't buy the Taiwanese food easily in Pittsburgh. I usually cook by myself. However, I can also find the fast food, like Macdonld or KFC, just like in Taipei.

Although there are many differences between Taipei and Pittsburgh, I still like the different way that I experienced. Also I hope I can getting better and better in the future.","Living in a foreign country is usually a difficult thing .

So, I looked up some information by internet and I found two options: Merida and Barquisimeto. Both of them are very beautiful and it was so hard make a decision. I analyzed the similarities and differences between the two cities that I could finally come to my decision to visit to Merida.

Merida and Barquisimeto have a lot of similarities. First of fall, Merida has food as delicious as Barquisimeto and I could find this food in wherever place. Second, the nature in Merida is very similar to Barquisimeto. They have many mountains and a lot of green and flowers.

After I evaluated the similarities, I took my time to think about the differences between Merida and Barquisimeto and I realized that there were many importance things. The weather in Merida is more comfortable than Barquisimeto, because is colder and less sticky. Also, the population in Merida is funnier than Barquisimeto, and definitely I wanted to go to spend a great time, and this was a good argument. Finally, Barquisimeto is more expensive than Merida. Food, transportation and lodging is very expensive and I did not have enough money.

In Conclusion, after I considered all these things I made were very important to me. I wanted to tell you, that was a nice vacation and I had very good experience.","Last year, I wanted to do tourism in my country, and visit some famous city.

 It's known that China has the largest population in the world. To control the population there is a law: only one child per couple in China since 1978. If women have their second child, they will lose their jobs and pay a lot of money in fines. Otherwise, these women must be arrested and sent to hospital abort their second fetus. Many people think it's unreasonable and rule. However, I think it's the best choice for China and each family's members, no matter for the right of human or the children's education or the guarantee of the parents' old life.
 Many foreign friends think controlling women's reproductive rights is against human right . However, I think not only women have the right to give a birth to their children, but also that children have the right to live a high quality life, not just have food and clothes. Because there are too many people in China, the resources each person can use is limited; schools are so crowded; teenagers want to study in university are so difficult. Because many people can't stand on their own feet, sometimes they are forced to break the law, such as: robbing, stealing, murdering and so on. Pollution is serious in China because so many people need industrial products. For above reasons, do you think your children can live g high quality life? Moreover, you will decrease others' life quality if you give birth to more children because more population will make the situation more serious.
 Most parents want to give the best life and education to their children, but they don't know what way is right. Many people think that some children have been spoiled, and grow up to selfish and dependent men/women because there is only one child in a family, I think what style the child will become dose not due to whether he is the only child or he has some siblings, but depends on what kind of upbringing the child can get from his parents. For raising a good child, we can look for some effective methods, such as: culturing good behavior, teaching children to consider others' need, encouraging do their things by themselves since they were children. Now, more and more young parents realize the importance of the children's education and learn how to raise children through TV, books and internet since they are pregnant. Many Chinese realize that we can't only give birth to our children, but also need to help our children to pursue the happiness of life. In order to help their children having more interesting and special skills, they send their children to some special classes, like music, drawing, chess and English classes. Many parents have a full-time job; if they have two or more children, they will have not enough time and money to support a better education for their children.
 A traditional thought in China since 2000 years ago ""If I raise more children, there are more children can support and take care of me after I am old."" However, the world has changed. Many young people's salary is only enough for their own expenditure, also some of them even let their old parents support them, and many young people will get a job in other cities, they also can't take care of their parents. On the contrary, many grandparents have to help raising their grandchildren because their children haven't enough time or don't want to spend so much time to take care of their own children. In addition, many parents have pension after they retired, they don't need their sons give their money. Moreover, it is a better guarantee for their ""golden years"" if they deposit the money that they use to raise another child for the cost of the nursing home. In brief, if a couple only have one child, they can not only enjoy the relationship with their child, but also save some money for their ""golden years""; even though support their child sometimes. 
 China is a very intelligent and industrious nation, it has beautiful territory that is full of milk and honey, but just because the huge population, Chinese can't live a high quality life. One child per family is the best way to control the population and improve people's life. Controlling population dose not just benefit china, but also the whole world, especially the pollution, the food problem and the employment of the world.

Abortion is the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy, and many women turn to abortion when they have accidental pregnancies. It is a very serious issue in most countries in the world today, with many people for it and many people against it for their own reasons. Some people reject abortion because they believe it is an immoral and unethical murder. People who support abortion believe it is a human right for a mother to decide if she wants to keep her baby. I support abortion to be used to end accidental pregnancies when it is absolutely necessary while we also need to be careful so it is not abused by irresponsible people who only want to end their unwanted pregnancies.
People who are against abortion usually think abortion is wrong because it is like murder that takes away the life of an embryo. They think that when an embryo is formed, the life of that embryo has already started. I disagree with them, because a baby is only a baby if he behaves like a human being. When an embryo is only a few days or weeks old, it cannot be called a baby because it does not eat, crawl, or cry. At this time it is only a cluster of cells without functional major systems found in humans, such as circulatory system, skeletal system, nervous system, etc. Without any of these systems that make us human, how can we say this is a human being already? Abortion stops this embryo from growing into a baby, so it should not be considered a murder.
 Abortion supporters believe that each mother has the right to decide if she wants to have the baby or not. A pregnant woman needs to carry the baby for 9 months to give birth. Therefore, it is her right as a mother to decide if she wants to end the pregnancy. This is also very important for rape or sexual assault victims who become pregnant because they are attacked. They have the right to have an abortion to deal with their painful experience. Also, if these victims cannot choose abortion and are forced to have unexpected lives born into the world without people taking good care of them, this will create more social problems.
 I support abortion, but we have to be very careful to decide who can have abortion to end accidental pregnancies. For example, rape or sexual assault victims can choose if they want to have an abortion. Abortion should only be done if the pregnancy is less than 3 months along. Also, if a pregnant woman is not a rape or assault victim, then she has to pay a big fine if she wants to get abortion. Thus people will not lie and say they have accidental pregnancy, when the pregnancy started because they are not careful. Finally, other ways such as adoption can also be recommended to avoid unnecessary abortion.
 The issue of abortion is a very difficult one. It is impossible to make both people who are against abortion and people who support abortion happy. However, there has to be very careful and appropriate abortion regulations and laws. Then, the unnecessary abortions can be reduced and women who really need abortion can still use their human right to stop unintended pregnancies.

I have to say that our government is for the unification and many citizens are for, too. There are several reasons why many people think that we have to unify including the fact that we are the same race, we have to end the war, unification will help the economy in both countries and we are able to protect our country by oneself because North Korea has been a very strong army. However, I am against the unification. I think that if we unify, per capita income will be decrease, cultural differences will be a big problem and politics problems will appear.

First, if we unify a big problem will raise for people in South Korea. All people's per capita income will decrease. For instance, Germany has been problems in that. Germany has been unified since 1990. Before the unification, West-Germany per capita income was 30,000 dollar per each person. However, after the unification with East-Germany their per capita income decreased and because of the reason that East-Germany economy was not developed than West, West had to invest a lot of money to the East for the balance of the economy. For that reason, the West economy potential decreased a lot. However, Unification with North Korea that national income is 100 dollar beside the South's national income is 10,000 dollar? This is one of my reasons why I am against the unification.

Second, North and South have lived over 50 years divided and we have a different culture. Now, not only our language but also how we live has changed a lot. Nowadays, many words from the North are difficult to understand. If we unify we have to change our textbooks. This will effect in many areas. Moreover, life in North Korea is totally different than in the South. The standard of living in the north is very low. It will be hard to live together with the good living South Koreans. We might have many conflicts together, crimes, fights, distinctions and political differences.

The most important thing is that we have different politic forms. The north is communism and the south is democracy. We know that North Korea is the only one country which is complete communism. Since, of the failure in communism, North Korea is going to breakdown in economy. However, they maintain their communism, yet. Since, they are very strong minded with it. They are closed to many countries. If we are able to unify, we might have many problems in politic. I can't believe unification in communism. Their intention is to unify the south with communism but if this might fail their only way to alive is self-destruction. 

50 years is a very long time. Many differences between North and South exist, language, culture, living standard and different political opinions. In present, it will be hard for the south, if we unify. That's why I am against the unification. However, we have to remember that we are a same race even 50years are passed. I hope that we might find good ways for a good unification. Now we are not enough prepared to unify.

However, I am against the unification. I think that if we unify, per capita income will be decrease, cultural differences will be a big problem and politics problems will appear. First, if we unify a big problem will raise for people in South Korea. All people's per capita income will decrease. For instance, Germany has been problems in that. Germany has been unified since 1990. Before the unification, West-Germany per capita income was 30,000 dollar per each person. However, after the unification with East-Germany their per capita income decreased and because of the reason that East-Germany economy was not developed than West, West had to invest a lot of money to the East for the balance of the economy. For that reason, the West economy potential decreased a lot. However, Unification with North Korea that national income is 100 dollar beside the South's national income is 10,000 dollar? This is one of my reasons why I am against the unification. Second, North and South have lived over 50 years divided and we have a different culture. Now, not only our language but also how we live has changed a lot. Nowadays, many words from the North are difficult to understand. If we unify we have to change our textbooks. This will effect in many areas. Moreover, life in North Korea is totally different than in the South. The standard of living in the north is very low. It will be hard to live together with the good living South Koreans. We might have many conflicts together, crimes, fights, distinctions and political differences. The most important thing is that we have different politic forms. The north is communism and the south is democracy. We know that North Korea is the only one country which is complete communism. Since, of the failure in communism, North Korea is going to breakdown in economy. However, they maintain their communism, yet. Since, they are very strong minded with it. They are closed to many countries. If we are able to unify, we might have many problems in politic. I can't believe unification in communism. Their intention is to unify the south with communism but if this might fail their only way to alive is self-destruction. 50 years is a very long time. Many differences between North and South exist, language, culture, living standard and different political opinions. In present, it will be hard for the south, if we unify. That's why I am against the unification. However, we have to remember that we are a same race even 50 years are passed. I hope that we might find good ways for a good unification. Now we are not enough prepared to unify.",3,

 90% of plastic surgery in Korea is done for purely cosmetic reasons. Therefore, it is difficult to get medical insurance for plastic surgery operation to accident. A large number of countries look badly of plastic- surgery of Korea and they even call Korea ""kingdom of plastic- surgery"", also package sightseeing of plastic- surgery is popular in Korea. I'm a favor of plastic- surgery, it's self satisfaction and stress, and it's preference of beauty women. 
 The first reason, plastic- surgery can explain self satisfaction and stress of the word. For example I have a six shape scar on my cheek. When I was a little girl, I got the scar. 50% of first meeting people asked to me ""Your cheek has something"" or ""why you have that?"" That is a big stress to me. Even though, they said without any meaning. Sometime I don't want to say same answer and I want to hide the scar on my mind. Every morning I make up for hide the scar. That is kind of my habit, if I have an opportunity. I want do plastic- surgery because disgusting to make up carefully and I don't want to hear same question from the people. Like this, the scar is stress to me even though my family and friends say not so bad. Exactly do plastic- surgery for myself satisfaction. If someone said I'm wrong, I want to ask them ""Can you live whole life, having stresses or complexes?"" or ""Do you know the stresses are how much big to them?"" In my opinion, anyone can't say against utterance about plastic- surgery. According to these reasons, choosing the plastic- surgery people are supposedly possible.
 The second reason, preference of beauty women is powerful in Korea culture. There is no one who doesn't like beauty women, but one of Korea words have ""Women is flower"" Here flower has two meaning, the inside of first mean is beauty that has a subtle perfume, the second mean is the flowers own extrovert perfume. For example Korea has 150 kinds of beauty contest. Also the beauty contest helps to get a job. If women are same incase, they would like to beauty women. This is a reality of life in Korea. Two years ago, Korea has a controversial issue what a women became an announcer in TV, but she had won in a beauty contest. However, the most important thing is the broad cast didn't against about the Miss Korea contest helps to be announcer. The broad caster said cosmetic is one of important things in the job, because the job is showed to audiences. These cases occupy a part of plastic-surgery. According to these occasions can be problem of plastic- surgery for make higher of their quality.
 Now a days the press say day after day about many women mobilize of many ways for their diet. However, the way is not different between men adhere to exercise enthusiastically and women adhere plastic- surgery enthusiastically. I'm a favor of choosing the plastic-surgery for their stress and showing to the people more charmingly. The life are no one's life, it's my life. The life is excepting me all second in our life.

It has dominated this world since the Second World War. I trust that it will keep the leader position in the next decade for three main reason as followingit is the main of the world, it always uses methods to keep its interests, and it has all kinds of people with talents. 
First, now the United States is the center of technology, economics, and military strength in the world. Then it uses these advantages to enlarge the difference with other countries. For example, Microsoft, which is an American company, dominates the computer business and more than fifty percent of people around this world use their windows systems. The United States has the top military strength in the world, and he sells his old style weapons to other countries like Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and so on to make money for researching the newest weapon. Therefore, it can still maintain as heart of the world in the future. 
Second, the United States prevents other countries from developing to threaten its position and uses other countries to obtain its own interests. Take Iraq for examplein my opinion, the United States attacked Iraq for stopping it trying to control the oil market. If Iraq owns more oil than now, it can control the oil price then the United States would have to pay higher price for this energy. Because the relationship between these two countries isn't good, the United States is afraid of that it can't get enough oil for maintaining maintain the routine working in the country. It had to stop Iraq getting development. On the other hand, the United States now use the cheap workforce in China and Mexico to produce their productions and then sells those around the world to get the great revenue. It keeps rich, progressive, and high income by other countries. 
Lastly and most importantly, the United States has always been a multicultural nation, contains all kinds of people from other countries, and everyone can get chance to achieve his dream there. It attracts people with talents for science, technology, etc. who want to stay there and develop their business. For instance, Yuan Tsen ANON_NAME_0, a scientist came from Taiwan, got the Nobel Prize in 1986 when he worked in the United States. His work supplied him the great education, environment, chance to finish the research statement, and to get the Prize. Not only Yuan Tsen ANON_NAME_0 but also thousands of people from other countries come there to work hard and dedicate all they have and they really got what they want. Everyone has the chance and will be accepted to this country so that more and more people with abilities gather there to achieve their dream and grow up this country. That is the most important part for the United States can be the leader in the world now.
In conclusion, the United States can dominate this world in the next decade because he leads the main core of science, technology, economic, and military strength in the world that can't be in place of. It only focuses on his own interests, uses other countries to get what it wants and prevents other countries from developing. Moreover, it contains the smartest people in the world and attracts more people to come here to work. I trust that the United States can dominate this world in the next decade.

 About 10 years ago, emigration became very popular in Korea. At that time, Korea was in serious depression and many people wanted to leave Korea to be abroad such as USA, New zealand, Austrailia. After I came here, I have met a lot of emigrants from Korea. I got to know the reasons why people emigrate by asking immigrants. There are 4 big reasons; dissapointment with Korea, education in Korea, economic problems in Korea, and quality of neighborhood. 

 The first reason people leave Korea is the dissapointment with the Korean society. We are dissapointed with a lot of illegality and corruption in Korea. I know that and agree with that fact. However, the person who complains about own country complains about every country. I saw many emigrants who always complain about illegality in US. And, we have to have a kind of responsibility for our nation. We need do something for our nation not just leave without any responsibility.
 The next is the education of children in Korea. Because a korean educational system is so changable, many students have a rough time of it. And if children go to the US, they can learn English so easily. It takes some risks. It can be confusing for children. Because they are still young, they can be confused about themselves between US and Korea. In addition, their confidence could be weaken because they can't communicate well. It's especially dangerous for children. We can see in case of Cho Sung Hee.
 The third is about employment and economic problems. Even after struggling economically for several years, we still have troubles with the economy. People moved abroad to find job better than before. However, even if they have a huge hope about US, it's not really as good as they thought. Because foreign country is not own country, it's hard to adjust and settle down well. Though some body had a great job in Korea, it cannot help going through hardships. I have two aunts who emigrated 10years ago. Whereas they hoped a wonderful life in the US, a reality of life is not really so. In case of one of friends who is immigrant, it's not easy to get a job in Pittsburgh. I can see the friend is having hard time in USA.
 The last one is a quality of neighborhood. Most cities in Korea especially Seoul is too busy and crowded, and also has a lot of air pollutions. However, other countries look pretty nice to live. Although the fact, I've felt so dangerous in USA, since I came here. Even though Korea is not as beautiful as US or Austrailia, I can say Korea is more safe and good to live.
 In conclusion, I want to mention about national traits. I know that most people who left Korean don't like Korea so much. Despite the nation dissapoint us, we also have huge responsibility of own nation. We must improve and make our nation good with staying in own country. I hope that many people become significant people ,and love and help the nation. And I'll also do my best to be so.","About 10 years ago, emigration became very popular in Korea.

In colonial times, Maracaibo was an Independent and autonomous Republic, and it was integrated to the Unit of Gran Colombia in equality of conditions to the other countries that formed this unit: Venezuela, Nueva Granada and Ecuador. When the Declaration of Independence from Venezuela was made, the government proposed that Maracaibo could be part of Venezuela to contribute with the economic and political growth of the new country. This proposal was approved because Maracaibo has huge economic and enough resources, such as; oil, agriculture, and so on to support the country. Since then, the resources that Maracaibo produces are completely transferred to the country's capital, where they have been administered by corrupt governments, and they have made to Maracaibo one of the poorer regions of the country. Nowadays, Hugo Chavez is the president and dictator of Venezuela and this situation is getting worse because Chavez denies to the population of Maracaibo the access to wealth that are produced in their earth and worked by themselves. In 2006, Rumbo Propio that is an organization for the democracy stated that the new proposal is to recover our autonomy to become us in an independence republic to decide how to use our resources in our territory. I agree with this proposal, because it will bring the three fundamental freedoms demanded by the Marabinos since 11 years ago: Political, economical, and intellectual and moral freedom.
We want to have political freedom, which is necessary to live in an orderly country. Currently, the policy depends on the central government and it does not carry out its function to maintain our country with security, justice and public works. The local government, which is opposition to the ideals of the actual president, is respectful of the liberties of the population, and has pure intentions to developing our state, but it is limited in its functions, powers, and attributions. For example; Maracaibo needs more infrastructure, but our president and his administration do not assign this requisition to the budget, and we cannot have more roads for a better transportation into the city. We need a neutral state that does not tell to people what to think, feel or believe. Nevertheless, the state controls our politic, taking away our right a freedom of speech against what we consider injustice for us and our families.
Rumbo Propio (2006) stated ""Maracaibo only represents 6.90% of the national territory, but it covers 80% of the national production of oil and hydrocarbons"". (ANON_URLPAGE) Furthermore, Maracaibo is the largest producer of diverse agricultural, cattle, and marine resources. However, Venezuela has a government controller of the economic resources, which are directed to the pleasure of the president without making a distribution right than each state produces and require. In addition, it denies to Maracaibo many resources that are vital to grow and to generate employment because the population of Maracaibo is opposed to its ideals. We want to have economical freedom to administer our resources and to guarantee jobs to our population to decrease the poverty that we suffer. 
The Intellectual and moral freedom is necessary to develop our norms of coexistence, without coercion or privilege. The central government should not manipulate our education, to tell us what part from history are good or bad, or what we must learn or not. For example; In August 2006, the program of education were changed and it includes communist thoughts, like ideas against capitalism. In fact, Chavez wants to eliminate all private company. Furthermore, in some new books they changed our history in favor of Chavez's ideas. The government wants to control the education and they want to tell to our children that the poverty is good and that the money only must be in the hands of the state. In 2006, ANON_NAME_0 Sabino admitted, ""Chavez has given a phrase that the poverty is good and that the wealth is bad"" (ANON_URLPAGE). We have a lot of wealth but the most important is intellectual wealth. We want to discern our own ideas and to decide what the best thing is for us. 
I know that a lot of people in Venezuela disagree with this proposal because they need our resources and Venezuelans have a strong feeling to live like a family, but we do not want to belong to a country whose people support, humiliated, a dictatorship that is organized like being endless, because Chavez wants to have an infinite re-election, without shame or fear of history. There are many blind people who love Hugo Chavez and his supposed social equality which has became us poorer. Maracaibo has owned and owns economic conditions that make our life totally feasible as the sovereign state, and the autonomous feeling of us will not die. I consider myself more Marabina than Venezuelan, because I have this sovereign tradition, and I hope that my hometown will become the free and independent state. Marabinos are defending the right of our state to participate in the construction of our present and future. 
","In colonial times, Maracaibo was an Independent and autonomous Republic, and it was integrated to the Unit of Gran Colombia in equality of conditions to the other countries that formed this unit: Venezuela, Nueva Granada and Ecuador. When the Declaration of Independence from Venezuela was made, the government proposed that Maracaibo could be part of Venezuela to contribute with the economic and political growth of the new country. This proposal was approved because Maracaibo has huge economic and enough resources, such as; oil, agriculture, and so on to support the country. Since then, the resources that Maracaibo produces are completely transferred to the country's capital, where they have been administered by corrupt governments, and they have made to Maracaibo one of the poorer regions of the country. Nowadays, Hugo Chavez is the president and dictator of Venezuela and this situation is getting worse because Chavez denies to the population of Maracaibo the access to wealth that are produced in their earth and worked by themselves. In 2006, Rumbo Propio that is an organization for the democracy stated that the new proposal is to recover our autonomy to become us in an independence republic to decide how to use our resources in our territory. I agree with this proposal, because it will bring the three fundamental freedoms demanded by the Marabinos since 11 years ago: Political, economical, and intellectual and moral freedom. We want to have political freedom, which is necessary to live in an orderly country. Currently, the policy depends on the central government and it does not carry out its function to maintain our country with security, justice and public works. The local government, which is opposition to the ideals of the actual president, is respectful of the liberties of the population, and has pure intentions to developing our state, but it is limited in its functions, powers, and attributions. For example; Maracaibo needs more infrastructure, but our president and his administration do not assign this requisition to the budget, and we cannot have more roads for a better transportation into the city. We need a neutral state that does not tell to people what to think, feel or believe. Nevertheless, the state controls our politic, taking away our right a freedom of speech against what we consider injustice for us and our families. Rumbo Propio (2006) stated ""Maracaibo only represents 6.90% of the national territory, but it covers 80% of the national production of oil and hydrocarbons"". (ANON_URLPAGE) Furthermore, Maracaibo is the largest producer of diverse agricultural, cattle, and marine resources. However, Venezuela has a government controller of the economic resources, which are directed to the pleasure of the president without making a distribution right than each state produces and require. In addition, it denies to Maracaibo many resources that are vital to grow and to generate employment because the population of Maracaibo is opposed to its ideals. We want to have economical freedom to administer our resources and to guarantee jobs to our population to decrease the poverty that we suffer. The Intellectual and moral freedom is necessary to develop our norms of coexistence, without coercion or privilege. The central government should not manipulate our education, to tell us what part from history are good or bad, or what we must learn or not. For example; In August 2006, the program of education were changed and it includes communist thoughts, like ideas against capitalism. In fact, Chavez wants to eliminate all private company. Furthermore, in some new books they changed our history in favor of Chavez's ideas. The government wants to control the education and they want to tell to our children that the poverty is good and that the money only must be in the hands of the state. In 2006, ANON_NAME_0 Sabino admitted, ""Chavez has given a phrase that the poverty is good and that the wealth is bad"" (ANON_URLPAGE). We have a lot of wealth but the most important is intellectual wealth. We want to discern our own ideas and to decide what the best thing is for us. I know that a lot of people in Venezuela disagree with this proposal because they need our resources and Venezuelans have a strong feeling to live like a family, but we do not want to belong to a country whose people support, humiliated, a dictatorship that is organized like being endless, because Chavez wants to have an infinite re-election, without shame or fear of history.

French criticize Koreans for eating dogmeat. They regard Koreans as barbarians because 
Koreans eat dogmeat. For example, in 1999, the French actress Brigitte Bardot criticizes Koreans for eating dogs. She sent the message to Korea that Koreans have to stop eating 
dogmeat if they want to open the 2002 world cup because many foreigners who would visit Korea in the 2002 world cup think that eating dogs is awful. But, Koreans are not barbarian for eating dogmeat. There are three reasons why Koreans are not barbarians: Dogmeat is a part of cultural heritage, we never kill dogs with cruel method, and all dogs do not become dogmeat. 
 First, eating dogmeat is a part of cultural heritage. In the ancient society, we were 
starving and finding something to eat. That is why Koreans came to eat a dog at that time. 
They started to eat dogmeat from B.C 3000. The French missionary Daren stated that the most delicious Korean food was dogmeat in 1847. Also, in the Sagi, which is a history book, Koreans ate dogmeat in the special day and gave it Korea's king. In other words, 
Koreans have traditionally eaten dogmeat so far. 
 Second, Koreans do not use a cruel method when they kill dogs. They use an electric shock now. They do not want to kill dogs with a cruel method. If someone in Korea wants to kill dogs with cruel method, most Koreans will accuse someone of killing dog with that method. 
 Lastly, all dogs do not become dogmeat. Koreans think that dogs are divided into two parts ""for eating or for a pet"". If a dog is for a pet, they never eat a dog. They eat just a eating dog. This means that some dogs are specially bred on food and pets are never eaten. 
 Some foreigners criticize eating dogmeat and regard Koreans as barbarians. 
Koreans are obtaining a bad image because of them. However, dogmeat is Korean 
tradition and Koreans are inheriting their traditional heritage. Therefore, foreigners should not call them barbarians.

The last years have had a big problem on the border between Mexico and US: the illegal immigrants. The illegal immigrants are people that cross the border by swimming the Río Bravo River, walking for the desert or entering the US by whatever without legal papers and a visa. These people want to enter the US to fulfill the ""American Dream"" (in Spanish ""Sueño Americano "").They want to have a more comfortable life and find a job living like Americans. Although they just want to work, I'm against the illegal immigration because it's against the law and it's not the right way to cross to the US but, I'm for the legal immigration to study, to spend vacation or even to work legally.

First, sometimes they have only studied until high school and most of them have to maintain a family. Also, they come from poor families. Because they don't have a good education and their families are very poor they have to emigrate very young to another place to find a job (in this case to the US). If you combine this with the economic problem in Mexico, it comes to be something really bad for them. 

The situation in the US is better than in Mexico. For example, the minimum salary in Mexico it's equivalent to $5 dollars per day. In the other hand, the minimum salary in the US is like $6 dollars per hour! In addition, United States is a safer place to live because in some places of Mexico, like Mexico City, you have to take care too much of your things because there are a lot of delinquency on the streets . These conditions make to people emigrate to a better places. 

I think that going to another place looking for a job is nothing bad. The problem here is that they come to the US illegally. Furthermore, the immigrants don't do anything bad to Americans. In other words, they don't take them away their jobs because Americans have better jobs. The immigrants always work in something that the Americans don't want to do. For example, they are gardeners, painter, repairing houses and even in Mc Donalds or Burger King.

I'm actually Mexican and now I'm a student. Sometimes people don't believe that I'm Mexican because Americans have the image that Mexicans are lazy or bad people that come to the US only to work illegally . For me, this is bad because not all the people that come to US are illegal workers. Sometimes Mexicans come to study, to spend vacation or come to work but in a legal form. I'm against the illegal immigration because it is against the law but I'm ""for"" the legal immigration. I think that the government of both countries has to work in this area because even if the government happens to construct a wall, the Mexican will find a manner to enter to the United States illegally. I think that the procedure to get a visa to work or the way to enter to the US should be easier for Mexicans because it's neighbor country and the Mexicans are not terrorists!

Then, it was stopped before the stop sign and the driver checked the other street if it was safe to cross. Actually, the direction of the other street was from the right to the left. She glanced toward the left side. As soon as she continued driving, there was an engine sound made by a bus and coming from the right side. She might not have heard it and drove slowly. As the car was in the center of the intersection, a loud piercing noise was produced out of the bus. The car which she used was crashed by the bus even though the bus tried to avoid hitting it directly. The car was forced to turn around ninety degrees and then stopped. The good thing was the car was hit on the passenger side and only she was in that car. She looked shocked and did not get hurt at all. Hopefully, the riders on the bus were not hurt as well.",3,

Imagine a situation where there is a huge, evil, and vicious monster that always comes to your hometown to disturb and eat livestock, or even people, once every 365 days. What would you do to survive in this situation? Thousands of years ago, according to the traditional Chinese legend, the Chinese people had to face the monster ""Nian."" The monster was called ""Nian"", meaning ""year"", because the monster came once a year. During the periods that the Nian monster appeared, the ancient Chinese people discovered there were three main things that it was very afraid of. They used the color red, loud sounds and bright lights, and stayed in the house together and made noise as weapons to scare Nian away every year. This is the reason why Chinese New Year celebrations ever since then include using red decorations and envelopes; lighting firecrackers, bright torches and red lanterns; and keeping all family members inside the house together. 
Each year before Nian came, on Chinese New Year's Eve, the first thing that ancient Chinese people needed to do was to prepare red decorations and paste them on walls, windows and doors of the house to scare Nian away. Also, they would prepare the red envelopes with a little money, called ""lucky money"", to give to elders and children, not only to protect them from Nian, but also to keep them healthy and safe for the entire next new year. Even today, the red decorations people install have become the ""spring couplets"". These are paper scrolls and squares inscribed with blesses and auspicious words, such as good fortune, wealth, happiness and springtime. Also, the paper squares are usually pasted upside down, because the Chinese word for ""upside down"" is a homonym of the word ""arrival"". Thus, the spring couplets represent the arrival of spring and that a whole new year is coming. In addition, the red envelopes with money have become the most important part of Chinese New Year for children.
The second thing that would be done before Nian came was to light firecrackers all day and night to drive Nian away. The ancient Chinese people would also light bright torches and red lanterns and then hang them around the house. Today, people still light red lanterns and firecrackers, especially a huge barrage of firecrackers to symbolize the family's everlasting fortune. However, lighting bright torches is no longer necessary. Instead people keep lights on for the entire night and also try to stay up all night to welcome the New Year. It was long believed that by doing so on New Year's Eve, the elder generation will live a longer life.
The most important thing before Nian came was to keep all family members in the house together. The ancient Chinese family members would stay in the house and talked loudly to each other. It was not only to scare Nian away, but also the members would have more courage when they stayed together. Now, people living far away from their families will always begin to prepare for their journey home several days before Chinese New Year's Eve. Then, everybody reunites and enjoys a magnificent dinner together. The dinner tends to be especially lavish and every dish regarded as symbols of good luck are served. During the most important meal of the year, family members talk about the past year's events that happened to each of them and the new hope for the next new year. During Chinese New Year's Eve, spending time with family members is the most important thing after people worked hard during the past year. 
Today, people keep these traditional habits and events to continue the most significant festival for Chinese people around the world. The red decorations and envelopes, firecrackers, bright torches and red lanterns, and keeping all family members in the house together are all symbols that ""tradition"" and ""family"" play very important roles in Chinese people's notions and lives. No matter what changes may occur during this time, the notion of staying together with family will always connect the hearts of family members and Chinese New Year celebrations.

If what you are speaking can not be understood at all by people around you, if you do not know at all what people are saying, and if you cannot find those familiar TV programs at all that you get used to watching after dinner for more than a couple of decades on the TV channelshow would you get through this situation and survive it? Several months ago, I started to experience this situation because I just moved to the United States from China. Obviously, moving to the US has changed my life dramatically. Nearly all daily experiences are new to me, but the most remarkable are: diet change, language change, and media diversity change.
Before I arrived here, I was extremely occupied by my daily work. Sometimes, I had to stay in the office for fifteen continuous hours, so I ordered take-out frequently. Or if I could squeeze out one or two hours, I preferred to have my dinner at my favorite restaurant which would provide dishes with my hometown style. At that time I never considered food from other countries because I deeply loved my hometown's food and hardly diverted my attention to other styles. Now I have tried several Chinese restaurants here, none of which can satisfy me at all. Since it's impossible to get the satisfying authentic Chinese cuisine, I decided to make them myself. Actually this is a big challenge for me, because I seldom did it in China. However, I'm between jobs now, so I could spend a lot of time on learning to cook. Moreover, I gradually realize that cooking myself will definitely make me stay much healthier than before, because I learned how to take advantage of the principles of traditional Chinese medicine to make the daily diet function as a precaution for those diseases in an early stage that could not be detected by western medicine.
Another big change for me is learning to speak English. In those days in China, I was not required very often to keep in contact with foreigners. So, speaking English was not what I focused on. Speaking Chinese was enough for me to earn a living. When I came here, I suddenly found that my English was a big problem that could not be cracked easily and much more serious than what I imaged if I wanted to get into a top business school to finish the MBA program. I have been shocked by my past idea that if I was exposed to a foreign language environment enough I could be able to speak English fluently. That's too naïve. I feel that even if I am in an English language environment, I am expected to speak English actively with others. In this way, I could possibly make progress on the road to improve my English proficiency. At the beginning, I spent all my day time listening to VOA(Voice of American) special English, and then I turned to VOA normal news program. Later, I had a fixed language partner and every day I had a conversation with him for about two hours. Then I forced myself to show up in a variety of events. At the same time, every day I immerse myself in different audio podcasts and video programs for at least two hours, even though I feel very sick of it. I also keep a regular conversation activity over the phone with my American friends. Now is time for me to read a little more to make me familiar with more words and stories, although I still keep reading the 'New York Times', 'Business Week' and the 'Wall Street Journal'. Before, I often asked myself what the ending point of learning English is. Now I want to say there is no such a point, it is a lifelong study. In this process of change, my big harvest is that I figure out my common problems when speaking English and Chinese. These problems are not exclusively related to speaking English but also exist when I speak Chinese. So, I can take the right approach to get over them and save a lot of time.
Finally, the available media resources here are much more diverse than in China. TV programs I can watch in the US are completely different from what I watched before. In the prime time period from 7 pm to 8 pm each day in China, nearly all TV channels are required to broadcast the same news program 'China Central TV News'. This requirement has been effective for half a century. However, there is no such kind of requirement for a TV program across the US. What I have seen here is that every cable TV channel has the right to decide what news will be on air or not. In this way, I have more opportunities to access different reports and different aspects of the same news and I will have a better position to see what's truly happening. Actually, TV programs to some extent, I think, have reflected the difference between uniformness in Chinese culture and diversity in American culture. What surprised me surprised is that I can find the influence of 'uniformness' in most daily behavior and thoughts. For example, I unconsciously like to dress in the same way as others and even tend to avoid standing out of others by remarkably different colors in clothes. 
In a word, for me life in China and life in the US vary mostly in terms of the way to get meals, the language in communication and the number of available media sources. These changes are going to definitely influence my future life: helping me stay healthy, making me communicate with others effectively in the global world and recognizing the importance of diversity. On one hand, I will never forget my roots in China. On the other hand, I feel very happy to experience these changes in my life.

 Imagine you are dropped on an island where you don't know anybody, have to start a new life again or have to learn new things to survive while your friends in your hometown are enjoying a normal life. South Korea is not an island but I felt like that situation when I had to make a new start there. I used to live in Germany for 10 years. I was not born there but I spent my whole childhood in Germany. My family moved to Germany when I was 2 years old and moved back to my country when I was 13 years old after my father finished his studies. At that time, I couldn't believe that I had to leave my friends, school and my hometown of Wiesbaden. While I was living in Korea, I couldn't see my future. I couldn't start or won't start a new life in a country that I didn't know. It took a long time to overcome to got used to the country for three reasons: many differences between Germany and Korea school, problems in learning the language and personality differences. 



First, it was not easy to be accustomed to a culture that I had lived in for just 3 years. Almost everything was different between Germany and Korea. I realized it when I had my first day in school. The first day in school was surprising because I was accustomed to the German schools. I considered that we had to wear uniforms. Before I went to a school, I had to buy a uniform and I tried it at home. I predicted that a different school life will begin. In a German school, we never were wearing uniforms. I could wear whatever I wanted. However, here in Korea, I had to wear that stuffy thing. Moreover, I had to put on similar shoes and cut my hair short. All students looked the same because it was the rule for everyone. We looked like a small army of boys and girls. I thanked God that the school was not only with boys. That was the same, but that is where the similarities ended because we were divided in other classes. 
Moreover, we had teachers who sometimes hit us with books or sticks when we not followed the teacher. I was very shocked about that because in Germany, I had never seen it before. Hitting at school is prohibited. Furthermore, the teacher was like a king or a dictator for us. We had to listen to a boring class where the teacher taught us and student's only listened it was a class without interaction. In contrast, Germany schools had between teachers and students many interactions together that made the class more interesting.

Second, to learn a language was not easy for me. I was not able to speak the Korean language because I used it only at home. I knew just a few words. My brain was always thinking and dreaming in a German language.
Because of this, I had problems in conversation with my classmates. Some students laughed about my pronunciation. Some students were very kind to me teaching bad words in Korean which I realized later. In addition, it was difficult to follow the class. I was losing more and more interest in studying at school. Furthermore, it was really difficult to make friends. I felt like I was behind the others. I wanted to go back to Germany where my friends were living without this problems. 

Third, I had some differences with my personality. When I lived in Germany, I lived as a German. I did what Germans men did. However, in Korea I was confused about me. There is no doubt that I am a Korean, but it was not easy for me to think that I was not a German. I thought, in German, I had German habits and I wanted to be left as a German. I couldn't think as a normal Korean usually did. In addition, in the past when I was in middle school, we didn't have many students from abroad. For instance, I was the only one who came from another country. However, nowadays we have many experiences with students coming from and going abroad. It was difficult to mix myself to the others. I felt alone and many times behind the others.

In conclusion, this event changed my life. Although I had many problems in getting used to Korea, learning a new language and personality differences, I overcame my problems finally. It was really hard to get accustomed to another culture, because I couldn't find any similarities between them. Almost all things were so different and I felt really lost on an island.

Could the man in the iron mask act as a real king after he was eventually rescued from a sixteen year prison? In Dumas' famous novel, the man in the iron mask, the notorious Louis X IV, was dethroned by his identical brother, Philippe. The ex-con, Philippe, transforms into a king with three week training by master musketeers. It could have been the fancy details in a novel or it could have been an example which tells us the influence from nurture. However, the gravity of intelligence, nowadays, has been over emphasized and people even take it as the very code to achieve success. In fact, it is the powers of nurture, namely, environment, learning, and experience which drive a person to be a king or to be the man in the iron mask.
 First of all, environmental effects sculpt people to become what they are. For example, Chinese people represent a conservative image. The possible causes of that could be exiles, frequent wars, and lethal diseases, which have constantly kept them losing their property during thousands of years of history. Consequently, Chinese people have gradually turned into a group people who intend to seize everything they have. Reflecting this characteristic, they like investing in and possessing real estates symbolizing to hold their roots. American people, on the other hand, prefer focusing on the future. Being the descendant of Puritans, they have the glorious history of trekking across oceans and conquering continents, which eventually lead to the super domination of the U.S. Accordingly, they emphasize on exploring the unknown and the future. Space projects are typical illustrations to explain their personality.
 In addition, personality which has been acquired through long term social adaptation has been proclaimed another fragment to complete occupational integrity. Psychologically speaking, the Big Five Personality, such as Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience, are believed to be moral factors we are born with. Either positive or negative, these five factors can be modified by the process of social adaptation, or simply learning. To disentangle the personality modifications via learning, scientists have studied cases of identical twins indicated that identical twins, who have identical genetic background, share distinct personalities from each other, which shows that learning can affect natural moralities greatly. The most famous example of acquired personality is the ability to control negative emotions, such as anger. A person who has good emotion control ability is considered to be a person who have good emotion quotient (E.Q). E.Q. currently has been said to be the most valuable personality trait by most decision makers. More and more popular, test takers in big recruiting companies are required to take an E.Q. test rather than an intelligence quotient (I.Q.) examination. Thus, a person who has higher E.Q. scores has higher chance to acquire a high salary job. 
Finally, experience is also the positive energy to overcome obstacles in our life time. As the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc, Steven P. Jobs has the most twisted story of the power of experience. At his early stage in Apple, Jobs has devoted all his efforts to play a role as the major competitor against the operating system giant Microsoft. Subsequently, Jobs had been forced to leave Apple. Then established another hardware oriented computer company, the NEXT Corporation, which provided a reasonable price on educational computer systems. Steven Jobs soon realized that the NEXT system is a very advanced system; however, it can not be popular or successful in the market because of the competition with other computer companies, such as Microsoft and IBM. Through his accumulated experience, he learned that working on hardware oriented business may not be his way out. Thus, Jobs had learned to focus on software, and that led to the birth of Pixar, the most welcomed and lucrative animation movie studio in the world, which had produced comic legendary such as ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" before its acquisition by Disney. Furthermore, with the combination of NEXT and Apple, Steven Jobs has returned to the company he co-founded. With the previous experience, Jobs has stopped carrying on unreasonable competitive methods against Microsoft. That is, he has changed Apple from a hardware-oriented company to entertainment-oriented headquarters which led to the hits of the ipod and saved Apple from its financial crush.
To conclude, natural factors can be affected by environmental effects, long term learning, and precious experience. The exaggeration of native intelligence should be carefully avoided. Most people, for instance, might stop learning if he or she is admired as a smart person. That could limit their potential of being successful. As a result, to approach success, we should make up our mind and stay humble to acquire abilities we do not have and this is a process called nurture.

Thus, a person who has higher E.Q. scores has higher chance to acquire a high salary job. Finally, experience is also the positive energy to overcome obstacles in our life time. As the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc, Steven P. Jobs has the most twisted story of the power of experience. At his early stage in Apple, Jobs has devoted all his efforts to play a role as the major competitor against the operating system giant Microsoft. Subsequently, Jobs had been forced to leave Apple. Then established another hardware oriented computer company, the NEXT Corporation, which provided a reasonable price on educational computer systems. Steven Jobs soon realized that the NEXT system is a very advanced system; however, it can not be popular or successful in the market because of the competition with other computer companies, such as Microsoft and IBM. Through his accumulated experience, he learned that working on hardware oriented business may not be his way out. Thus, Jobs had learned to focus on software, and that led to the birth of Pixar, the most welcomed and lucrative animation movie studio in the world, which had produced comic legendary such as ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" before its acquisition by Disney. Furthermore, with the combination of NEXT and Apple, Steven Jobs has returned to the company he co-founded. With the previous experience, Jobs has stopped carrying on unreasonable competitive methods against Microsoft. That is, he has changed Apple from a hardware-oriented company to entertainment-oriented headquarters which led to the hits of the ipod and saved Apple from its financial crush. To conclude, natural factors can be affected by environmental effects, long term learning, and precious experience. The exaggeration of native intelligence should be carefully avoided. Most people, for instance, might stop learning if he or she is admired as a smart person. That could limit their potential of being successful. As a result, to approach success, we should make up our mind and stay humble to acquire abilities we do not have and this is a process called nurture. ","Could the man in the iron mask act as a real king after he was eventually rescued from a sixteen year prison? In Dumas' famous novel, the man in the iron mask, the notorious Louis X IV, was dethroned by his identical brother, Philippe. The ex-con, Philippe, transforms into a king with three week training by master musketeers. It could have been the fancy details in a novel or it could have been an example which tells us the influence from nurture. However, the gravity of intelligence, nowadays, has been over emphasized and people even take it as the very code to achieve success. In fact, it is the powers of nurture, namely, environment, learning, and experience which drive a person to be a king or to be the man in the iron mask. First of all, environmental effects sculpt people to become what they are. For example, Chinese people represent a conservative image. The possible causes of that could be exiles, frequent wars, and lethal diseases, which have constantly kept them losing their property during thousands of years of history. Consequently, Chinese people have gradually turned into a group people who intend to seize everything they have. Reflecting this characteristic, they like investing in and possessing real estates symbolizing to hold their roots. American people, on the other hand, prefer focusing on the future. Being the descendant of Puritans, they have the glorious history of trekking across oceans and conquering continents, which eventually lead to the super domination of the U.S. Accordingly, they emphasize on exploring the unknown and the future. Space projects are typical illustrations to explain their personality. In addition, personality which has been acquired through long term social adaptation has been proclaimed another fragment to complete occupational integrity. Psychologically speaking, the Big Five Personality, such as Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience, are believed to be moral factors we are born with. Either positive or negative, these five factors can be modified by the process of social adaptation, or simply learning. To disentangle the personality modifications via learning, scientists have studied cases of identical twins indicated that identical twins, who have identical genetic background, share distinct personalities from each other, which shows that learning can affect natural moralities greatly. The most famous example of acquired personality is the ability to control negative emotions, such as anger. A person who has good emotion control ability is considered to be a person who have good emotion quotient (E.Q). E.Q. currently has been said to be the most valuable personality trait by most decision makers. More and more popular, test takers in big recruiting companies are required to take an E.Q. test rather than an intelligence quotient (I.Q.) examination. Thus, a person who has higher E.Q. scores has higher chance to acquire a high salary job. Finally, experience is also the positive energy to overcome obstacles in our life time.

 The Bible says people's desire to reach to heaven by building a tower named Babel provoked God's wrath. Thus God says, ""If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other."" Named after the Bible's story, the movie 'Babel"" brings in subjects that the world confronts now. Despite living in a so-called global village, people are divided into culture, language, race, class, and religion which lead people in crisis. Alejandro González Iñárritu, the auteur of ""Babel,"" seems to ask a premise of human beings' communication, or perhaps miscommunication. If so, what really causes this problematic and apathetic society? Rather than looking for an answer, he observed the world and applied his unobtrusive camera working, idiosyncratic sequence editing, and verisimilar narrative to ""Babel.""
 First of all, Babel's unobtrusive cinematography makes the movie more realistic. Unlike other recent movies, it shows modest camera working. Babel's camera does not cross the line of reality and observation. Seemingly, it acts like a bystander of the scene which is exactly what the director intended. It thoroughly avoids unnecessary intervention. Besides, its inconspicuous camera working is given a great deal of weight to ""Babel"" because it does not untangle a story by telling you with script lines. Since ""Babel"" deals with four different languages in three continents, consequently, visual readability is crucial for ""Babel."" Possibly, it could be thought somewhat monotonous because there are no distorted perspective scenes and compelling sequences that usually recent movie audiences demand. However, what he sees in the world's reality of life is not rapid and thrilling. 
 Second of all, his distinctive and splintered sequences editing enhances its realistic quality. Having four different stories in three continents, it tangles the time line of the stories in the movie. It starts from Arabic boys of a barren and remote desert village of Morocco, an American couple who are travelling Morocco, a Mexican nanny of an affluent family in San Diego, and eventually it reaches to a deaf-mute schoolgirl in Japan. Completely unrelated yet comprehensible, his threads of tales do meet in the movie and finally make sense even more in your mind. There are no boundaries on life and time, and at a certain point, his twisted integration of sequences is similar to our glimpse instead. 
 Finally, ""Babel"" paints verisimilar plots and issues that you might come across in the real world, such as a detailed depiction of a Moroccan family with a goat herd, an American couple who have marital problems, an illegal immigrant Mexican nanny, and a deaf-mute schoolgirl whose mother killed herself recently. Any of his characters and stories do not seem to be unreal. Even though he does not tell anything about them and gives least information, we feel familiar. In addition, all of his four stories in ""Babel"" are very plausible and actually could happen around us. He uses small stories to tell controversial issues today. It is no more ""the others'"" problem yet ours to solve together. Admittedly, he does know how to weave stories to show what the problem really is. 
On the whole, in ""Babel,"" having been inspired by miscommunication, mistrust, and incapable of understanding in the world, the director paints the movie with exquisite observation of the world in which he sees bleakness and instability. Also, as with his perspective of the world, he directed the movie with splintered sequences and wove threads into a sole movie along with truly believable stories that make people reconsider the world and society.

 Do you know Benjamin Franklin? Here are his achievements; great management ability for influential newspaper companies, lots of inventions about science and technology, active involvement to the politics and the diplomacy, and well-known writings. After reading these works, you may imagine he was in an academic family and got an organized education under respectful teachers. However his background was totally opposite, and nobody says that his splendid business and academic results are due to his environment or well education. Rather he did not receive any regular schooling and even had to help his father in a factory since a young age. In this story, it shows that his intelligence was from nature not environment. Even though there are many discussions about the origin of intelligence, the fact that people are born with intelligence is more reasonable than the theory of nurture (environmental acquired intelligence), when we consider genetic evidence and a case of genius.

 According to the development of science, genetic evidence of intelligence has become the most primary proof. Scientists have been revealing the secret of human genes, at the same time they have started to decode the genetic information. Inventing new medicines and gene engineering are the other results of the genetic science, and the location of intelligence of the DNA is not the new issue any more. With this newly created map on the human genes, we found the genetic relation between parents. Hence the genes- containing idiosyncratic intelligence- came from their parents, are lasting for a whole life, and also will continue to their offspring. For example, if some defects are in the genes, they would not be totally recovered by the environment. Though some good education and well-organized surroundings are helpful to improve the intelligence, they are trivial in comparison to the effect of genes, because it is already determined mostly in the genes.

 In addition, we can overview of the cases of genius. About four years ago, a boy was famous of his intelligence in Korea. Even though his age was six, he had mastered regular education course in high school, and has been researching high-class physics theories with some university professors. After knowing his story, most of Korean people started wondering, ""Did his parents offer special program to him after his born?"" ""Did his mother have secret know-how about baby care?"" With many people's interest, the main medias (TV program, newspapers) inspected his life and his parents' education methods. However there was nothing special. His parents loved him like other parents way, and had concern for their child's future. Nowadays the boy still studies the physics in a university and makes people imagine his hopeful future. In this story, we can not find any other special event or relationship between him and his environment; just his natural intelligence can explain the reasons of his works. Therefore, this is also a strong evidence of natural intelligence.

 Although many scholars insist on the important effects of environmental support and reactions of the relationship in development period, that is just a subsidiary way compared the critical effect of gene decision. Therefore, after considering the genetic evidence and case of genius, we can not help coming to the conclusion that the intelligence is nature rather than nurture.

 Have you ever heard a Chinese legend about Mencius? Mencius, who was a very famous philosopher in Asia, wrote a lot of books and he impacted on the Asia culture. When he was young, his mother wanted him to grow up well, so she moved many times because of his education. First, she moved to a nearby department store and then he had imitated a clerk's acting. Second, she moved to a nearby a religion area. By then, the he had imitated about shaman's acting. She was thought that there were not suitable places. Finally, she moved to a nearby school, by then he had studied too much and he was going to be a famous philosopher. This story gives us a lesson that intelligence is mostly the result of the interaction between people and their environment regardless of nature. I support that nurture is more important than nature. There are three reasons why nurture is more important than nature: Man is a social animal, people can get intelligence from effort and sometimes genius is ruined.

 First of all, an Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, said ""Man is a social animal."" People should depend on social environment. People can not live alone. Otherwise, people have influenced by societal environment. People were taught, think and speak in their environment. Even though a genius was born, sometimes environment makes a person who is a genius change stupid person because of bad an environment.
 
 Second, people can get intelligence by effort. Edison, who was a famous inventor, said ""Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration."" Sometimes, people do not know the maximum. People lose a lot of opportunity in their life. People think ""I can not do this. I am not a genius. Maybe a genius is going to do this one."" they give up their job even though they really want to do it. We can get everything we want. We can fight what really we want to do. If our life is already destined by God, we can struggle against fate and then achieve our new destiny. I have a motto in my life that ""Effort can not abuse in my life."" Even though I do my best, if I did not get my job that I want to do, then I did not do my best. 
 
 Lastly, sometimes genius can be ruined. I know a friend who was my schoolmate in high school. He was a great baseball player. Most people thought he was going to be great baseball player and envy his talent of baseball. Actually, Hyun ANON_NAME_0, the Korean baseball team, nominated him in a draft. However, his environment was not good because he had a lot of friends who liked to drink alcohol. Since he was nominated by the baseball team he had not practiced baseball and had started to drink many days. In the end, he lost his job. Today he is working in a restaurant. He could have played baseball. Even if he practices his job, he would be great baseball player. 

 In conclusion, this essay has presented three reason of why nurture is more important than nature: Man is a social animal, people can get intelligence by effort and a genius is ruined. Therefore, as in 'Nike' advertisement, 'just do it' regardless of nature.

Imagine a man who is your cherished brother, son, or lover. He must go to the military because in his country it is mandatory even if he does not want to go. How would you feel? In most countries, people do not have to go to the military. However, men in Korea must go to the military. Because I am a Korean, I went there for two years. Many people think that men in Korea who must go to the military waste their time there, and are afraid for their cherished brother, son, or lover to go there. However, it was a valuable experience for me. Through the military service, I was able to gain three worthy skills: leadership, independence and responsibility.
The first skill which I was able to gain after I finished the military service is leadership. There are too many tasks which soldiers must carry out. That is why a soldier cannot carry out by himself and must cooperate with each other. Therefore, a sergeant who is a soldier of the highest position must lead a team which consists of privates and complete tasks which the team must carry out. For example, when I became a sergeant after one year and three months, I had to lead my privates and order them to work to complete my tasks. When a private did not want to follow me, I had to make him work. The way which I made him work was just to persuade him. At that time, I persuaded many privates and realized that persuasion was the key of leadership. Because of these experiences, I was able to gain leadership skill from the military.
The second skill is independence. It was the first time for me to live alone without my parents. I had to do everything by myself. For example, I had to wash my laundry, clean my room, and wake up at 6 A.M everyday. Also, whenever a sergeant ordered me to work, I had to finish the work by myself no matter what it was even if I did not want to work. In addition, when I became a sergeant, I had to do my work without anyone else's help. Nobody was able to help me because I was in the highest position at that time. While I was in the military, I had to keep the two words ""by myself"" in my mind.
Lastly, the most important skill I learned is responsibility. In the military, sergeants manage their team. If their team fails to work or makes a mistake relating to the work, sergeants have to bear the responsibility for their team because they are the soldier of the highest position within the team. That is why, as soon as I became a sergeant, I had to take the responsibility instead of other soldiers. For instance, I was an army driver in the military. If my privates were injured by a car accident, I had to take them to the army hospital and take care of them. Also, I had to explain the situation in front of all of the soldiers instead of the privates who had the car accident. In other words, I had an important responsibility to take care of my soldiers.
In Korea, people who must go to the military feel desperate before they go to the military. However, it is the best opportunity to grow up by themselves in the military. To summarize, I could grow up because I gained leadership, independence, and responsibility from the military. During the military time, Korean soldiers have a precious experience which they cannot experience again in their lifetime.

Thoreau, an American essayist, once said, ""There is no remedy for love but to love more."" Motherhood is a process. There are emotions and experiences related to a sense of strong affection. It is a love that has no remedy but to love more. It is a journey to be traveled. Motherhood has changed my self-image, my world and it has changed me. What you are doing for another person is so fundamental and in a beautiful process, you can discover that you are able to do it even though it is a very demanding job. Being a mother has many different changes in many different areas. The most important areas to me are: social, physical and emotional.

Every human being has a role in society. A mother's role varies in different cultures and this is one of the most important changes in the social area of motherhood. The relationships between friends and family change, the time for social activities decreases because caring for the baby becomes the first priority. In my culture, it is important that a mother stays with the baby as long as possible. That means that sometimes the mother decides to quit her job because of the baby. A new and special relationship is developed between the mother and the baby and the love is the special ingredient in it. Because of the love that you have for your baby, you can deal with all of the social changes that have come into your life.

Another important change that comes with motherhood is the physical change. Most of the time these kinds of changes are not pleasant. When you are pregnant, hormonal changes affect your skin, hair, body, teeth and nutrition. Each one of these areas has specific elements that our body has to re-accommodate and this is very hard to do. The senses change, particularly the sense of smell. It intensifies the odors, and the food that was pleasant before is now unpleasant. Your body has to support two bodies instead of one. You are exhausted with all of these changes. The love for your baby supports you in this period and through this new stage of your life.

Finally, the emotional changes that accompany motherhood are very important because they implicate the psyche of the mother. There are different elements involved here: stress, emotional insecurity, sexual changes, problems with self-esteem, and fears about miscarriage. Each culture has different ways to manage these changes. In my culture, the family is a big support. They can help you with advice about the situation that you are living or can help you with financial problems that may be a cause of stress. In both cases, the love of the family is fundamental to go through the emotional changes. Psychological changes are fundamental in this emotional process. Pregnancy is a big and important event in the life of every woman. However, opposing feelings can appear during this time. On the one hand, it is a deep joy. On the other hand, there are a lot of fears to deal with. The question is: Who I am? How I am going to be a mom? A lot of different emotions jump into the heart of the future Mom. This feeling that we call 'love' reminds us: ""Don't worry, be happy, you can do it!."" I am a witness to this phenomenon.

Motherhood does not have a 'definition'. The practice of motherhood, plus to live it every day, is the best way to me to understand the meaning of it. Motherhood is a journey of love, a never ending road, a style of life that you can share with others, and is a mystery to be solved.

First of all, a ""good student""normally refers to one who is good at getting high grades. For example, in the school, what the teachers care mostly about is how well the students perform in his or her class. The standard is whether a student could get high grades. At home, for another example, before leaving for school, the parents would again and again tell their children to study hard and try to get perfect scores. When you are talking with friends, they would also compare their grades to yours.
Secondly, in order to get a satisfactory job in your future you should get a higher education. You might feel heavy pressure. One example is illustrative. Choosing a major is very important for you. If you are thinking about a hot major which would give you an easy job and good salary, many others will have the same idea as you. Therefore there will be a lot of competition. Even if you finish your graduate school, there is no guarantee that you can find your desired job. 
Finally, there are a lot of pressure for students like me who go abroad to study foreign languages. I have been an ELI student for several months, and I still remember that when I first saw an American movie, the pronunciation of American people and the countenance when they were speaking surprised me. Because of the different cultural background, it is difficult for a foreign student to understand deeply what the American people are thinking. It is also hard for us to correctly use the new vocabulary and some words we know.
In conclusion, the pressure of being a student such as getting the top grades, thinking about the future and studying foreign languages will continue to push us studying hard. You need to face those challenges.

Indeed, the earthquake has many effects on people's life, but there are three main impacts of destroying buildings, causing the economic damage, and depriving many of their lives.
 As we know, when an earthquake occurs in some place, many buildings are destroyed. The houses and apartments fall so that many people have to stay outside. If it is winter, people must suffer cold weather. There are many commercial and industrial buildings which collapse, so people couldn't work. For example, It is an estimate that there are several thousand houses to fall in China in 2005. The government would build houses enough for people after the earthquake.
 The earthquake could impact on economic development because an earthquake destruction is serious. If people would rebuild the building, they must pay much money. After an earthquake is over, there is no electricity or water. So the shops are closed, and the manufactures could not produce. For instance, the cables under the sea break because of the earthquake, the internet does not work, so that many trades could not be finished. The earthquake could prevent economic progress.
 In fact, an earthquake has the most effect on people's lives. When an earthquake takes place, many people could not escape to the safe place, so the buildings fall to suffer heavy casualties. If some people are seriously hurt, and they are not timely cured, they would die. Although the earthquake has been over for several years, some people still have evil dreams in the midnight. So the earthquake makes some people feel horrible. 
 In conclusion, although the earthquake has effects on the building, the development of economy, and people's lives, people believe that man could be able to predict when an earthquake will happen with scientific progress. At last, people could deal with the earthquake.
 

","When people know that an earthquake is coming, they feel terrible, and then imagine that the earth has gaps, all the creatures face a death, and the world will come to an end. Indeed, the earthquake has many effects on people's life, but there are three main impacts of destroying buildings, causing the economic damage, and depriving many of their lives. As we know, when an earthquake occurs in some place, many buildings are destroyed. The houses and apartments fall so that many people have to stay outside. If it is winter, people must suffer cold weather. There are many commercial and industrial buildings which collapse, so people couldn't work. For example, It is an estimate that there are several thousand houses to fall in China in 2005. The government would build houses enough for people after the earthquake. The earthquake could impact on economic development because an earthquake destruction is serious. If people would rebuild the building, they must pay much money. After an earthquake is over, there is no electricity or water. So the shops are closed, and the manufactures could not produce. For instance, the cables under the sea break because of the earthquake, the internet does not work, so that many trades could not be finished. The earthquake could prevent economic progress. In fact, an earthquake has the most effect on people's lives. When an earthquake takes place, many people could not escape to the safe place, so the buildings fall to suffer heavy casualties. If some people are seriously hurt, and they are not timely cured, they would die. Although the earthquake has been over for several years, some people still have evil dreams in the midnight. So the earthquake makes some people feel horrible.

Y,K1312,12180,df9,Korean,Female,283,4,w,1753,2,597,546,546,"Can you imagine the world without the media such as television, newspapers, radio, and the Internet? Everyday we come to know any news with unconsciousness through the media as we don't realize air even though we need it. That is why the role of the media in our lives is very important. Although people have become wiser than what they were yesterday, we are still affected by mass media. Now, I would like to think about the roles of the television; shaping public opinion, reporting news, and giving entertainments.

 The first role of the television is to shape public voice. A poll taken by broadcasting station helps us to realize others? thinking of certain issues. For example, according to these questions ""How do you think about the punishment by death?"" and ""Do you agree or disagree to having gun?"" we could know the public voice that live in the same time with us. In addition, there is another role of television at a presidential election survey. We would like to know about an approval rating of candidates before the election. Television's survey could give public information about candidates or approval rating, which make it very important to choose the president for people.

 Furthermore, another powerful function of the television is to report news, which is easy for us to pass by without television news. I watch the morning news everyday. It gives me the crimes or accidents news that happened last night with weather information. Occasionally I watch the car accidents on the television news, I become careful of driving. And I can also prepare for an umbrella when I watch the rain forecast. Moreover, I get a lot of living information such as how to make Italian foods and choose fresh grocery. Sometimes a professional person shows the know-how about home decoration or recommends travel places. I think that it's direct and effective way to get many kinds of news and information from the television. 

 On the other hand, television has another valuable role as well that is to give entertainments. People want to take a rest from watching amusement shows after they come back home from their work place at night. Some people say that entertainment shows in television make people fool but I don't think so. In my case, when I'm very tired so I don't want to move my fingers, I turn on the television and watch the funny shows with delicious foods. It's really comfortable time and helps me to forget about my worries or stress. Even though I don't understand English perfectly, it's not a problem during that time. It's just for enjoyment. Besides, various genre dramas in television such as Prison Break, Sex and the City, and Grey's Anatomy also give fun and enjoyment to people. In fact, these amusement shows and dramas in television intend to protect people from a sad or a lone feeling. 

 In conclusion, although we are not conscious of it, we live in and with the media. Among the various media, television shapes general voice, reports lots of information, and gives enjoyments to us. These roles of television make television valuable and help people to live fruitfully and enjoyably. Moreover, I guess that its role in our lives will be increasing more than now.

Y,S228,12318,fs4,Spanish,Male,283,4,w,1753,3,373,352,352,"Nowdays, the world has a big problem that affects all humans without distinction: Pollution. In the human history people have maltreated the planet. Many years ago damages could be fixed by own nature, but now population is bigger, and the effect of pollution has become more dangerous. There are three crucial points to talk about pollution: natural effects, economical effects, and social and political effects.

It is obvious that pollution has an important effect on nature. The cities and factories are huge and they produce tons and tons of residues and garbage. Those residues are difficult to eliminate and make the land and water to be contaminated. They reduce the value and the right uses of ground and cultivations, and it is also a real problem in drinking water. In addition, factories, machines and cars all over the world generate too much CO2. This causes air pollution and global warming.

It is a truth that occidental countries see pollution like a threat. Because of that the society is being persuaded and habits are changing. But it is not enough. Big improvements and political decisions must be done to solve the problem. It means new sources of energy instead of petroleum, and global and organized ways of act. It is a fact that cities and population are bigger each day. In this sense, it seems absolutely necessary to recycle all kinds of residues in big amounts, and to involve citizens and companies of every country.

But if we think in the improvements mentioned before, another effect appears: Economy. All this means money. On one hand, the world is guided by the rules of economical interests of a few powerful men. On the other hand, improvements and develop involve huge inversions with results only in a long term. So the question is not as simple as it could seems.

In conclusion, pollution is a real problem nowdays and its effects involve many areas. The planet need improvements, but it will not be easy because of economical interest. In any case humanity must do something to avoid worse consequences, if we think about the future.

The process of learning English contributes with the framework of economic,social/cultural and sciences development of individual learners.

Therefore we will achieve greater success by speaking English.
 Learning English leads to a better understanding of cultures and permits us to participate in mass consumer culture.

In addition learning English permits us to connect with popular US films,tv, music and other forms of mass entertaiment. 
 Learning English opens the door to great tecnology and science news.These can have a tremendous impact on our lives.Everyday we have major advances in the field of sciences, tecnology and genetics.Since internet have started people like to be communicate around the world especially by computers so English can give us the opportunities to be informed.

Y,C795,12586,bl7,Chinese,Female,287,5,w,1814,2,1166,1159,1159,"Nowadays people in my home country, Taiwan, live an abundant and plentiful life. I cannot imagine a generation of turmoil where people lose their belongings, home, family, and even their own lives anytime and anywhere in their own country. During The Eight Year War of Resistance against Japan from 1937 to 1945 (during World War II) and then the Chinese Civil War in 1949, this was what happened to my grandparents. From my grandmother's own words, starting from the time my grandfather joined the army to the time of the retreat to Taiwan, my grandfather, grandmother, and their family members endured all kinds of unimaginable sufferings and hardships. 
When Grandpa left his countryside home, parents, wife and a newborn baby who was only a few months old, he just got married for 1 year. He was just a youth in his 20's and he left his home to join the army. The day he left, he walked and turned back his head over and over again. He smiled to his family members and waved goodbye to them. He never thought about that he would never see his parents ever again, and he would not hold his wife's hands again until almost 50 years later.
Grandpa was a very brave soldier; he did everything that his officers assigned to him. He killed the enemy troops as much as he could and never ever felt afraid; he hid with his comrades in a dense forest which could not see the skylight even during the daytime for several days with nothing to eat and drink except plants' roots and seeds and rain. They waited for the enemy troops to pass the forest, and exterminated them with bombs and machine guns. He disguised as a farmer and entered the enemy's base to assassinate a general. He almost got killed when he carried out the mission, but he was saved by his best-friend comrade who in the end died in front of him. He stole in an enemy's battalion with his 9 comrades during the darkest night and exterminated the whole battalion's enemy troops, almost 500 soldiers. He followed his army to participate in battles everywhere in China. Everything he did was for the hope that he could finally go back home and see his dearest family. However, nobody could promise him when he could go home and he could not contact his family members. He did not know if they were still alive or dead.
Grandma was a lady from a wealthy family who lost all family members during a large-scale air bombing. She could not find other relatives she knew, thus she joined the volunteer nurses to take care the soldiers who were injured. This was how Grandpa met her, his second wife.
 Just like a romantic wartime love story, Grandpa and Grandma supported and helped each other during the most difficult time. Although Grandpa tried his best to figure out the information of his parents, wife and son from his hometown, he still could not find out anything. In addition, he really appreciated that Grandma was willing to be with him, and he married her. 1 year later, their first son was born. They had a short, happy moment for several years. Then, their second son, who would be my father, was also born during this time.
 The situation during the war was getting worse. The enemy troops were everywhere. They killed people, even women and children who could not fight back. They burned houses, buildings and historic landmarks that were built hundreds or thousands of years ago. Grandpa brought grandma and their sons to follow the army, and tried to escape to the safety city of Chongqing, Szechwan. However, they could not keep up with the army's pace because they wanted to help and care for another family which lost their father. When they were trying to catch up to the army, an enemy troop suddenly appeared.
 The two families were very scared and afraid, but they could not find a place to hide because the road only had small rocks and no trees or houses. The enemy troop started to shoot, and killed the family which lost their father, and then they saw Grandpa and Grandma. Grandpa quickly pushed Grandma and their first son to his back quickly and held their second son tightly. He did not know what would happen next but just stared straight at them. There were no sounds, so quiet and even the air stopped moving. A colonel walked out of the enemy troop and spoke to Grandpa in Chinese with a thick accent. ""I want the child, the one you hold in your arms. Leave him behind and I will let you go."" When Grandpa still tried to think about how to respond to him, Grandma had already rushed out and kneeled down in front of the officer. She cried and shouted, ""Please don't take my child away! Please! I kneel down before you! I kneel down before you! Please! Please!"" The colonel did not listen to her, and a soldier ran out and hit her head and hands with the butt of his gun. Grandpa wanted to save Grandma, but he needed to protect their sons. He just shouted, ""Stop! Please stop!"" He held their boys, kneeled down, and moved with his kneels to try to stop the soldier. The boys cried and screamed. Grandma's head and hands were bleeding, but she still tried to kneel down and kowtow to the colonel over and over again and said persistently, ""Please, please, please!"" The colonel spoke again, ""Leave the other boy then, the big one."" He walked to the boy and wanted to grab him. Grandma crawled to the boy and held him in her chest very tightly. She would never let anyone take her sons away. 
 Fortunately, maybe the god Buddha and the goddess Bodhisattva saw this scene, an army appeared on the other side of the road, and they shouted and attacked the enemy. The colonel and the enemy troop were killed, and Grandpa, Grandma and their sons were finally saved.
 After The Eight Year War of Resistance against Japan and the Chinese Civil War, in 1949, they fled from the wars as refugees with Chang Kai-Shek's retreating army from China to Taiwan. Grandpa and Grandma started a new life together in Taiwan and raised their two sons and had another son and daughter. If they did not save their two sons together, their second son, my father, would be in the enemy's hands, and he would not have me as a daughter because he would probably never meet my mother. Almost 50 years after they arrived in Taiwan, Grandpa finally got in touch with his first wife and son who still live in mainland China, but his parents already passed away. This unimaginable and shocking story was told to me by Grandma, and I will always remember it in my heart.

Fortunately, maybe the god Buddha and the goddess Bodhisattva saw this scene, an army appeared on the other side of the road, and they shouted and attacked the enemy. The colonel and the enemy troop were killed, and Grandpa, Grandma and their sons were finally saved. After The Eight Year War of Resistance against Japan and the Chinese Civil War, in 1949, they fled from the wars as refugees with Chang Kai-Shek's retreating army from China to Taiwan. Grandpa and Grandma started a new life together in Taiwan and raised their two sons and had another son and daughter. If they did not save their two sons together, their second son, my father, would be in the enemy's hands, and he would not have me as a daughter because he would probably never meet my mother. Almost 50 years after they arrived in Taiwan, Grandpa finally got in touch with his first wife and son who still live in mainland China, but his parents already passed away. This unimaginable and shocking story was told to me by Grandma, and I will always remember it in my heart.","Nowadays people in my home country, Taiwan, live an abundant and plentiful life. I cannot imagine a generation of turmoil where people lose their belongings, home, family, and even their own lives anytime and anywhere in their own country. During The Eight Year War of Resistance against Japan from 1937 to 1945 (during World War II) and then the Chinese Civil War in 1949, this was what happened to my grandparents. From my grandmother's own words, starting from the time my grandfather joined the army to the time of the retreat to Taiwan, my grandfather, grandmother, and their family members endured all kinds of unimaginable sufferings and hardships. When Grandpa left his countryside home, parents, wife and a newborn baby who was only a few months old, he just got married for 1 year. He was just a youth in his 20's and he left his home to join the army. The day he left, he walked and turned back his head over and over again. He smiled to his family members and waved goodbye to them. He never thought about that he would never see his parents ever again, and he would not hold his wife's hands again until almost 50 years later. Grandpa was a very brave soldier; he did everything that his officers assigned to him. He killed the enemy troops as much as he could and never ever felt afraid; he hid with his comrades in a dense forest which could not see the skylight even during the daytime for several days with nothing to eat and drink except plants' roots and seeds and rain. They waited for the enemy troops to pass the forest, and exterminated them with bombs and machine guns. He disguised as a farmer and entered the enemy's base to assassinate a general. He almost got killed when he carried out the mission, but he was saved by his best-friend comrade who in the end died in front of him. He stole in an enemy's battalion with his 9 comrades during the darkest night and exterminated the whole battalion's enemy troops, almost 500 soldiers. He followed his army to participate in battles everywhere in China. Everything he did was for the hope that he could finally go back home and see his dearest family. However, nobody could promise him when he could go home and he could not contact his family members. He did not know if they were still alive or dead. Grandma was a lady from a wealthy family who lost all family members during a large-scale air bombing. She could not find other relatives she knew, thus she joined the volunteer nurses to take care the soldiers who were injured. This was how Grandpa met her, his second wife. Just like a romantic wartime love story, Grandpa and Grandma supported and helped each other during the most difficult time. Although Grandpa tried his best to figure out the information of his parents, wife and son from his hometown, he still could not find out anything. In addition, he really appreciated that Grandma was willing to be with him, and he married her. 1 year later, their first son was born. They had a short, happy moment for several years. Then, their second son, who would be my father, was also born during this time. The situation during the war was getting worse. The enemy troops were everywhere. They killed people, even women and children who could not fight back. They burned houses, buildings and historic landmarks that were built hundreds or thousands of years ago. Grandpa brought grandma and their sons to follow the army, and tried to escape to the safety city of Chongqing, Szechwan. However, they could not keep up with the army's pace because they wanted to help and care for another family which lost their father. When they were trying to catch up to the army, an enemy troop suddenly appeared. The two families were very scared and afraid, but they could not find a place to hide because the road only had small rocks and no trees or houses. The enemy troop started to shoot, and killed the family which lost their father, and then they saw Grandpa and Grandma. Grandpa quickly pushed Grandma and their first son to his back quickly and held their second son tightly. He did not know what would happen next but just stared straight at them. There were no sounds, so quiet and even the air stopped moving. A colonel walked out of the enemy troop and spoke to Grandpa in Chinese with a thick accent. ""I want the child, the one you hold in your arms. Leave him behind and I will let you go."" When Grandpa still tried to think about how to respond to him, Grandma had already rushed out and kneeled down in front of the officer. She cried and shouted, ""Please don't take my child away! Please! I kneel down before you! I kneel down before you! Please! Please!"" The colonel did not listen to her, and a soldier ran out and hit her head and hands with the butt of his gun. Grandpa wanted to save Grandma, but he needed to protect their sons. He just shouted, ""Stop! Please stop!"" He held their boys, kneeled down, and moved with his kneels to try to stop the soldier. The boys cried and screamed. Grandma's head and hands were bleeding, but she still tried to kneel down and kowtow to the colonel over and over again and said persistently, ""Please, please, please!"" The colonel spoke again, ""Leave the other boy then, the big one."" He walked to the boy and wanted to grab him. Grandma crawled to the boy and held him in her chest very tightly. She would never let anyone take her sons away. Fortunately, maybe the god Buddha and the goddess Bodhisattva saw this scene, an army appeared on the other side of the road, and they shouted and attacked the enemy.

 I had a horrible memory in a laboratory room. My major was chemistry so I liked laboratory work. When I was a freshman, most laboratory work was easy for me. I wanted to work hard such as Albert Einstein. When I was junior, I decided an organic chemistry of my major. When I went to go first time in an organic chemistry laboratory room, I thought that ""Wow, finally, my dream came true, it is really laboratory work, it is awesome."" However, nightmare was coming to me in laboratory room.
 
 First laboratory work was a blending material. I had confident because I had waited to do laboratory work so I studied for a long time. It was easy for me. My partner was proud of me. I did not listen the lecture because I already knew how I could handle it. While I was working the project, I assistant teacher gave my group warning because he wanted us to work together. I pretended to listen my assistant's advice and I kept going my job. I controlled good but, frustrating was coming to me.
 
 During laboratory work, I had a process to pour basic dyestuffs. There were basic dyestuffs and acid dyestuffs. I should have picked basic dyestuffs but, I picked acid dyestuffs. Suddenly, the blending material was burning. I was panic and I had no idea what I should do. I decided to pour water, but I could not my body. Everyone was frustrating. My partner called my assistant teacher. He brought sand and poring water. The fire was gone. I could not see my assistant teacher because I noticed a scowl on his face. He gave my group penalty and indicated cleaning the laboratory room. However, it was not finish my nightmare. 
 
 I cleaned hard because I wanted to recover trust. As cleaning in the laboratory room, my cellular phone rang. As soon as I picked up the phone, I head smashing sounds. A lot of laboratory work equipment fell dawn. I did not want to be there. I just wanted to run out from laboratory room. My assistant teacher said me"" I am going to give you 'F,' and as soon as finish to cleaning, just follow me."" After cleaning, I went to assistant room. He was smiling. 
 
 I wondered that he might be angry but not. He said ""why don't you apply to my laboratory room. I never have seen a student who prepared laboratory work."" I doubted my ears. I received this suggestion. Even though a couple of hours were nightmare, I catch a big chance. Since then, I have worked laboratory room.

While sitting peacefully on the chair of the roof, I surrounded by people so-called 'brothers'. Strangely, those who deserved my hatred for the countless advantage taking of me during my military serving were drinking and chatting with me harmony. That night, the sky was as clear and starring as my thoughts. After looking into their eyes one by one, the events and people I encountered appeared in my mind. 
 AS my stepping into the training center, I was totally shocked by the harsh atmosphere. Squad leaders yelled to cast their commands to move the trainees to do everything they asked. I held my anxiety and carefully followed the troops in ranks. Without surprise, there was no single hair on my head right after my putting on the uniform. Soon, I started feeling the disgusting advantages taking among soldiers. That was my first lunch in the camp. My lunch that day was supposed to be a bowl of beef noodles. Unfortunately, all I had was a cup of spice soup with a speckle of beef and pieces of noodles. Need no argument; I also had to take lots of physical and warfare training. Being an obese person, despair was not exaggeration during my first stage of my military service. All I could do was try my best to hang over. Eventually, the date of my transferring to new base had come.
 The next stage of my military service was being a guard of ammunition depot. On the first training day, I was assigned to regulate the storage of ammunition which means that I constantly had heavy duties to move ammunition everyday. Later, job function had become the core that led to advantages taking among soldiers. Since no one wanted to do the laborious duties, seniors intended to leave their works to raw soldiers because of our lower rank. Worse, there was also advantage taking among raw soldiers who were supposed to help each other to over come obstacles. I must be too naive to believe the code of brotherhood that soldiers should help each other until my acquiring a higher rank one year later.
 Since being a leader of five-man squad, my life in the barrack had become just a little bit easier. However, the raw soldiers gradually realized that they had to truckle some backstage supporters, such as captains and lieutenants in order to reduce their daily routine. From then on, the situation of advantage taking was getting worse, because they were now sensor soldiers. Further, the same echelon coworkers of mine even took advantages of me when we were assigned the same works. I really hated the behaviors of these irresponsible people, but I could do nothing. Meanwhile, I started using my casual time to study, because I did not have a Bachelor degree. Hence, I had to barrow free desk from captains or lieutenants, though they did not appreciate my frequently borrowing every night. Finally, one abominable captain seized a chance to expel me from the office while I was providing an excellent suggestion for him to solve his problems. However, I realized that I not only helped him to solve his problems but also hurt his pride after that event. That was the reason that he yelled ""At least I have a Bachelor degree! I need no suggestion from you."" Indeed, that was a heart breaking moment.
 From then on, I suddenly understood that every event happened during my military service was meaningful. Similar to an epitome of whole society, soldiers are composted by different kind of people. If I can not be successful in the barrack, I probably may not success in the other side of fence. I was tyrannized badly because of my low rank in military. Likewise, if I can not acquire a high social status, I might have to suffer the same situation. In order to acquire a high social status, I had made up my mind to study hard to enter a university. Almost a decade had gone by, I can still recall the faces, the talks and the oath in that starring night.

I had never seen so great swimming gymnasium in my youth. I loved to swim and I had spent most of free time in it during my stay in Beijing, no matter how summing or cold winter. Yingdong Swimming Gymnasium is a wonderful place for recreation and exercising. I will never forget how deep impression it is in the first time when I went to Yingdong Swimming Gymnasium. 

It is a fall season; I went to Yingdong Swimming Gymnasium. Arriving at the door of Olympic center, a large 'A' shape building is standing on the ground of the Olympic center. It is the gymnasium which hosted the swimming competition of 1990 Asian Games. I walked around a quarter, got to the door and bought the tickets and stepped into the door, there are four pools in the gymnasium, a standard pool which is 25 meters wide, 50 meters long and 3 meters deep; an exercising pool which is 12.5 meters wide, 50 meters long and 1.5 meters deep; a warming pool which is 9 meters wide, 12 meters long and 1.2 meters deep, and also have a great diving pool which is 25 meters wide, 25 meters long and 5 meters deep. It is so great; it is the largest in the Asia at that time. I have never seen so many great pools just in one gymnasium.

From then on, I spent most of free time in it. It is so convenient for exercising. I usually swim about half hour at shallow pool (1.5 meters deep) for warming and then move to swim about one hour in the deep pool (3 meters deep). After that I will took a hot water shower and a cold water shower and then back home.

 It was a cold winter. Almost every day except overwork days, no matter windy or snowy, the lifeguard can always find me at swimming. So we have got acquainted and become good friends later. I have learned that he was one of the first-class athletes of the national swimming team and got many gold metals. After knowing that I work at a national institute, he told me that I should keep swim that will help me energetic. He gives me a lot of help. He usually points out my wrong postures of swimming and tells me a lot of skills. During that period, my swimming skills have a significant progress. I really enjoy swimming. Swimming is really a good sport that helps me keep into shape. During that period, I was very strong and in a very good shape. 
It was a hot summer. I was a little upset. The swimming competition of 2001 World University Games was held in the Yingdong Swimming Gymnasium. The swimming pool is not opened for public so that I couldn't go to there to swim. That's my favorite place to swim and I couldn't meet my good friends at there. 

Now, the year of 2008 is coming soon, the swimming competition of 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games will be held at Yingdong Swimming Gymnasium. It's really a great place. Although I couldn't swim in the pool now, I really want to swim in that pool again.

Swimming is really a good sport that helps me keep into shape. During that period, I was very strong and in a very good shape. It was a hot summer. I was a little upset. The swimming competition of 2001 World University Games was held in the Yingdong Swimming Gymnasium. The swimming pool is not opened for public so that I couldn't go to there to swim. That's my favorite place to swim and I couldn't meet my good friends at there. Now, the year of 2008 is coming soon, the swimming competition of 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games will be held at Yingdong Swimming Gymnasium. It's really a great place. Although I couldn't swim in the pool now, I really want to swim in that pool again. Yingdong Swimming Gymnasium is really a wonderful place that I have spent lots of time in it. I will never forget its great buildings, convenient conditions for swimming, and also a good place to meet good friends, all of them. It's a place I will never forget.",3,

I had never been touched by people around me. I had known that my old sister was very diligent and perseverant, but I had never thought the extent of her perseverance. After that day, I completely changed my opinion about her and made my greatest effort to change my lifestyle to follow her when I was thinking of my old sister. The weather of that day implied something unexpected would happen.
One day at the end of the spring semester of my sophomore year, I received a letter from my old sister, in which I was told that she would visit me before twelve o'clock at noon on a certain day. The weather at the end of the spring semester, about June, which were generally expected to be warm, had become very hot and abnormally muggy. In the morning of that day when I got up, I felt I could not breathe. I just thought my sister should change to another day to visit me. I thought common people could not survive in a bus trip without air conditioning this kind of weather. If there had been a phone, I would have given my old sister a call to persuade her to change to another day. But at that time, the majority of people could not afford a cell phone, even a wired phone seemed too luxury for a common family. My old sister graduated from college one year before and worked as an assistant chemical engineer at Zhuzhou, a small city that is 30 miles away from my college. What I could do was to wait for her coming. After breakfast, I bought some ice and hold it in my vacuum flask for my old sister. Afterwards, I started happily to read a novel in my dormitory room, where any cooling device was not permitted to use it. The sweat drops was falling from my forehead onto my book and also some sweat drops formed into a creek in the middle of my back. I could not focus on my reading at all after a while because I was sweating hard. After time to time, I opened the vacuum flask and wanted to get a small piece of ice to cool me down. But I tried to stop my mind to go further to fetch the ice and I leaned my head out of window to see whether my old sister was arriving. Time was close to twelve o'clock, my old sister was expected to show up in a short time because in my mind she never missed an appointment, meeting or a promised task..
However, she didn't. In the next half an hour, I kept staring the entrance of my dormitory building but there was no her figure. I was becoming very anxious when I could not see her arriving. I began to think that my old sister probably missed the scheduled bus. But after a while, I changed my thought that today she could take a train. Or another idea popped up that she was busy with her work and could not set a time to come here. I tried to list all kind of excuses for her in my mind and I denied one excuse after another with time passing by. I gradually had such an ill luck for her. I was afraid that something bad happened to her. I bought food from Cafeteria to hope my sister could show up a little quickly, but I didn't touch them. I went out of my dormitory building and headed for the direction in which she would come. I scanned every people coming from that direction. Disappointment again and again made me felt a bit depressed. And continuously sweating made me feel extremely exhausted. I found a big tree and leaned against it to continue my waiting. In a short time I fell asleep and started a dream in which my sister smiled to me and I also I felt vaguely that some one was calling my name.
When I woke up, I was surprised that a girl was standing in front of me. When I opened my eyes a little wider, cleared my eyes with my hand and look at her much closer. It was my old sister. I suddenly recognized her. I cheered up to tears and I could not believe it. Her face was covered a layer of dirt. The sweat threads left an interwoven picture. Her shoes were also very dirty. Although she was somewhat tired, she looked very happy. She told me that she didn't take bus and train, but walked here on foot. Could you imagine that the distance was more than thirty miles. My great sister finished this distance just in 6 hours in such a terribly hot day. Then she continued that she felt very sorry about changing her mind because she wanted to save the ferry for my monthly living expense, I can't help crying.
After that so many times when I recalled the scene my old sister stood before me under that big tree, I break into tears once and again. Gradually, I try to save even one cent to help more people with the same situation as mine at that time. I hope I can hold this spirit onto my own children, so they can make a little contribution to our society.

What is your expectation when you travel somewhere? You can imagine that sightseeing as much as possible, meeting good people, eating several kinds of gourmet food?If you are satisfied by one of above examples, the place will be your unforgettable place. Moreover, if the good luck happens beyond expectation, you must hold that memory in your mind for a long time. Here is my unforgettable story from Belgium, Brugge.

The time was around 6AM, when I arrived at the station of train in Brugge. I was traveling around Europe by myself, and that was my first visit to Belgium. I went there by train from German and I was sleeping in the sleeping car of the train. Because I stayed in the train more for 7hours, and the arrival time was so early, I felt a little tired. However the view of the city looked so great, I was sitting in front of the station as thinking my schedule in the city. 

At that time two girls started to talk to me, they introduced themselves that came from Ecuador and were travelers like me. Because of passing many countries and meeting several travelers during my trip, I was also familiar to that situation of meeting friendly strangers. Above of all, I knew that the travelers could help each other and sometimes be a very close friend. We started talking about our travels and after a while they asked me where I would stay in the city. Actually, I was just going to search for some place to stay. They said that they were supposed to stay in a house which was introduced by their catholic church, and suggested me to go there together.

After I hesitated a while, I agreed to go there with them. During we were talking more, a car arrived near us and a kind-looking old gentleman got off the car. He was the man whom they were supposed to meet there. We introduced ourselves one another, and got on his car. He was so nice, and carrying a small memo pad. In the memo pad, there were summary of greetings in lots of languages. Later, he started guide the city to us. Though I was a little puzzled for the unexpected situation, I already was a kind of traveler whose intuition was developed according to one's itinerary, and decided to believe my feeling and their favor. 

The city, Brugge, was very beautiful city with several canals running between the delicate architectures. Even though I looked around more ten cities in Europe before coming there, it was coming to my heart as a city which made me feel happy due to the warm and friendly atmosphere. Thanked to the old gentleman, we looked almost of the city's charming points in a day, and took a rest in his guest room.

On the next day, I gave him a postcard I had written in the last night with appreciation, because meeting him in the city was unexpected good luck to me, and wanted to express my thanks to him. After reading my card, he showed me his visitors' book. I was surprised at the volume of books; he had more ten volumes of books in his bookshelf. At last, I found he was a pastor in a catholic church and always invited foreign travelers to his house to serve them sincerely. There were countless appreciations written by several languages in the books. Moreover, he rather thanked to me with a present for expressing appreciation. 

I had to leave the city in the afternoon. He went to a station to see off and gave me a snack package (some bread and fruits) with his blessing. On getting on the train, I was so sorry to leave the city as if I had stayed for a long time, and drowned in tears. Nowadays, I sometimes recall the memory of him and Brugge. Although I can not remember his face exactly, his wards are in my mind vividly. ""Every visitor is someone God sent to me, you are also the one God sent to me, so I'm happy to serve you.""

Now, do you live in your house? If you live in your house, you must be a lucky man. When I was in my country, Korea, I had never worried about housing because I lived with my parents. After I came to the U.S, I had to manage to find a house by myself. Fortunately, as soon as I arrived at the U.S, I was able to live with American family. However, I was very nervous whenever I came back home from the school because the neighborhood was dangerous. Eventually, I decided to move out and had to find my house. At that time, I thought that it was easy for me to find a place to stay. However, I could not find my apartment and house easily unlike my expectation. When I realized that I had no house to stay, my eyes were getting darker. Also, while finding my place to stay, I had to go through pain.
When I decided to move out from a place which I lived at first, I had to find my house. At that time, I was finding homestay because I wanted to live with American family to raise my English skill. Fortunately, as soon as I applied homestay's company, I was able to get a homestay's house which I was able to stay. Also, the homestay's house was very close to the school. In my case, I was absolutely lucky, so I was very happy. The day before I was supposed to move in, I packed my luggage up and finished preparing move-in. However, at that day's night, the homestay's host suddenly had a heart attack, so he had to go to the hospital. I was so embarrassed. I could not believe that I did not have my house from that day. Where should I sleep from tomorrow? I have to sleep a Subway or in the street? No I can't! At that time, luckily, one of my friend let me live his house. While living his house, I had to find my place to stay again. I was able to find an apartment which was close to the school in the web site. 
I called the apartment's host. He permitted me to live there because the host had to go to other city as soon as possible. Because of the fact that I was able to have my house, I was really happy. I started to pack my luggage up again as I kept whistling. After packing my luggage up, I called the host. However, the host did not answer the phone, so I tried to call him many times, but he never answered the phone. What happened to me? Something must have been wrong. I could not believe! He might have changed his mind, but I did not have enough time to blame him for changing his mind because I had to find another house. 
I started to find another house or apartment. Now, I did not care any more whether a house is close to the school or not. I just wanted to live ""my"" house. When I saw a house sublet paper on a board, I called the host's house. The host wanted to meet me, so we made an appointment. However, this time I did not pack my luggage up because I guessed that I might have experienced a situation like last time. After all, my guess was right. He did not show up on our meeting place. At that time, I was very frustrated and sad. What should I do? I will be homeless? I really wanted to go back to my house in my country. Suddenly, my phone started to ring. My friend called me and wanted to introduce a house which his friend lived in. I was able to meet his friend as soon as I hung up the phone. Fortunately, he permitted me to live his house. I immediately contracted with him to live there. Also, he was so kind and the house was close to the school. Finally, my unfortunate story ended up and I was able to live ""my"" house.
Now, there are no valuable things as important as a house for me. I will never forget the hard time. I realized that I had to prepare finding a place to stay. I hope that other international students will not experience to suffer from finding a place to stay.

Fortunately, as soon as I arrived at the U.S, I was able to live with American family. However, I was very nervous whenever I came back home from the school because the neighborhood was dangerous. Eventually, I decided to move out and had to find my house. At that time, I thought that it was easy for me to find a place to stay. However, I could not find my apartment and house easily unlike my expectation. When I realized that I had no house to stay, my eyes were getting darker. Also, while finding my place to stay, I had to go through pain. When I decided to move out from a place which I lived at first, I had to find my house. At that time, I was finding homestay because I wanted to live with American family to raise my English skill. Fortunately, as soon as I applied homestay's company, I was able to get a homestay's house which I was able to stay. Also, the homestay's house was very close to the school. In my case, I was absolutely lucky, so I was very happy. The day before I was supposed to move in, I packed my luggage up and finished preparing move-in. However, at that day's night, the homestay's host suddenly had a heart attack, so he had to go to the hospital. I was so embarrassed. I could not believe that I did not have my house from that day. Where should I sleep from tomorrow? I have to sleep a Subway or in the street? No I can't! At that time, luckily, one of my friend let me live his house. While living his house, I had to find my place to stay again. I was able to find an apartment which was close to the school in the web site. I called the apartment's host. He permitted me to live there because the host had to go to other city as soon as possible. Because of the fact that I was able to have my house, I was really happy. I started to pack my luggage up again as I kept whistling. After packing my luggage up, I called the host. However, the host did not answer the phone, so I tried to call him many times, but he never answered the phone. What happened to me? Something must have been wrong. I could not believe! He might have changed his mind, but I did not have enough time to blame him for changing his mind because I had to find another house. I started to find another house or apartment. Now, I did not care any more whether a house is close to the school or not. I just wanted to live ""my"" house. When I saw a house sublet paper on a board, I called the host's house. The host wanted to meet me, so we made an appointment. However, this time I did not pack my luggage up because I guessed that I might have experienced a situation like last time. After all, my guess was right. He did not show up on our meeting place. At that time, I was very frustrated and sad. What should I do? I will be homeless? I really wanted to go back to my house in my country. Suddenly, my phone started to ring. My friend called me and wanted to introduce a house which his friend lived in. I was able to meet his friend as soon as I hung up the phone. Fortunately, he permitted me to live his house. I immediately contracted with him to live there. Also, he was so kind and the house was close to the school. Finally, my unfortunate story ended up and I was able to live ""my"" house. Now, there are no valuable things as important as a house for me. I will never forget the hard time. I realized that I had to prepare finding a place to stay. I hope that other international students will not experience to suffer from finding a place to stay. ",3,

What do you think when you hear the word ""car""? May be, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Ford, new car, old car, sports car, prices, gas, conveniences, transportation or car accident? I think that cars are very convenient and necessary in our life to transport us wherever we want to go. Moreover, it is better to have a good car if you want to meet a nice girl. The more expensive it is the more girls are interested on you. They might be think that you are rich or a person of great capacity. However, I never knew before that a car has many other functions than I mentioned upside. In addition, how close and how a great part the car was in my life when I met my girlfriend. It was not only for convinience in transportation to get us together, it was more than I expected.

At first, we spent most of our dates in our convenient car. The car's name was Optima from the company KIA. The color was white and very pretty designed. Not big and not small and was easy to handle for women due to its very light wheel. However that is not all to describe my favorite place. I have a lot of good memories with my girl friend at this car. As I mentioned, it helped us to be together because the car was a nice transportation for us. We had no problems to meet whether we were for away from each other or not. Moreover, we both loved driving. We drove anywhere together with my girlfriends dog 'Neo' who is a British Coca Spaniel. He is bigger than usually Coca Spaniel's grew. We drove mostly to a place named Han Kang Park. It is placed beside the Han Kang River. It has a nice view and is a good place to have rest and enjoy. In Addition, it was a nice place for our dog Neo. After a walk with our dog we were in the car and listen music CD's which I burned and enjoyed either the nice view. At night the view is very beautiful. We could see the ships and lights from the other side of the river. With these wonderful atmosphere, we were able to talk trough the night. Our car date didn't end until many months. The first two weeks when we met, we were almost every day together at the park. If we were tired we could just sleep in the car. If we were hungry, we drove to a fast food or a pizza store ordered some foods and ate it in our car. If we wanted to see a movie, we drove to an automobile theater. After, we were finished with buying some clothes; we tried our clothes in our car. The distance to get anywhere was never a problem for us. We just needed fuel. In addition, we had no problems with the limited space. Actually, the limited space helped us to get closer than before. However, we were not always happy together. 

While having sweet dates in our car, we fought a lot either. I heard many times the car door slammed and saw even many times the back of the car that drove fast away. After we had a fought and we didn't make up, then, she jumped me up in front of my house and drove away and I had to see the back of our car. This was a hurt feeling. The wonderful fact is that I could feel my girlfriend mood when I saw the car. She was a good driver but if she was angry, she drove very dangerous. The car reflected her mind.

As long as our relationship continued, our time in the limited space decreased.
Since, we rented a house together where we could live in. That was actually my second
special place. I will never think that a car is just for transportation or convenience and I will never forget the experiences in that car with my girlfriend and Neo. We three were always together. The time with her in the car was a wonderful time for me. The car was more than just a car. It remind my memories.

I had never thought about people in the airport where people use there for going, coming and obviously not staying, before spent one night in the JFK airport in New York. It was January 4th, 2007. I arrived to the JFK around 6:00 p.m. Shortly after landed in the U.S. territory for the first time in my life, I was watching burning sky of the sunset over the Delta airline building and the terminal three and I started organizing about plans here with a deep breathing. As my next flight to Pittsburgh was January 5th 11:15 a.m., after found my one-year luggage, I had to find a place to stay for the night. I did call dozens of motels which were close from the airport did not have any rooms available at that single night. Thus rather than going to downtown to find a place, I decided to stay in the JFK that night. Because of 14 hours of flight and having same time period twice in that day again, it made me so exhausted. So I thought I could sleep anywhere if I could lean my head against a wall. However, interestingly enough, in the airport, there were many people to watch, to talk, and to share that night besides sleeping.
 Firstly, I needed a suitable spot to savor the night. After roaming around the JFK's terminal from one to eight, I settled down at terminal four which supposedly looked have more spectrum of people and events. Being an audience of an over 10 hours running time movie with the biggest screen ever, I prepared a newspaper, a cup of coffee, and full-charging mind of inactivity. Sitting in front of international arrival exit, I witnessed the people's precious life moments; a happiness of reunion, a heartbreak of farewell, an elation of approaching journey, and of course a tedious waiting of stopover flight. With these thousands of feelings and faces, I noticed the people behind the scene also. The employee at an information desk, a vendor of souvenir store and a clerk at the Starbucks were conducting their role. After spent almost three straight hour of enjoying, I noticed other audiences around me. Naturally, I felt friendly fellowship to them.
 I examined timidly yet curiously my neighbors. A Caucasian man behind me reading Lonely Planet which is very famous book about travel information, a Spanish family with a barely working baby at front low, an African-American business man talking on the phone and seeming newly married couple. Having been motivated and excited by diverse characteristics of people, I started expanding my territory.
 The man behind me was my companion. ""You look like traveling around here, where are you heading to?"" I started. ""Oh, yeah, hi. Actually I just got here- from England."" He responded with strong English accent. He had traveled several countries before came to the U.S. and surprisingly, he was planning to go to another 16 countries next to the U.S. He had worked as an architect for many years and he was taking a vacation. Thinking that night was too late to go a hotel and waste of money, he was staying there. Since I was interested in architecture, we could talk about many architectural master pieces. At the same time, I was impressed by having conversation between complete strangers because we were in totally different world and had never met each other. Literally, I was in entirely new world which nobody knew me and I did not know any body either and so was him.
 Again, the airport had another ordinary morning of normal day with gleaming sunlight. Supposedly, at the airport, people had come from somewhere and would have gone to their destination just like me. Despite the different intentions and purposes, I was amazed by the fact of sharing the moment together in the very same place and time in the world. When I was leaving the terminal four, I bought another cup of coffee at Starbucks. Just at that time, the clerk of Starbuck recognized me and asked ""Are you still here?"" ""Not any more."" And I left.

After her daughter was born, her life turned into a whirlwind. She was overwhelmed by her plethora of feelings; she could not deal with these feelings for a long time. She knew that her life had been changed forever.

Paty had always been a very positive and happy person. She is my oldest sister and a very good friend of mine. She was expecting her second baby. The whole family was waiting for that day with a lot of joy. The day arrived. It was a beautiful spring day. She went to the hospital, and after many hours of labor, the baby was born. She was the most beautiful girl that I have never seen. However, something was wrong. As soon as the baby was born, the doctors took the baby to another room for examination. However, Paty was taken back to her room. That was unexpected. She asked around what was happening, but she received no answer. She started to cry, she was scared, and she knew that something very bad was happening.

While Paty was trying to calm herself, the doctors were running back and forth performing multiple tests on ANON_NAME_0. Paty was desperate. No one wanted to answer her questions. Since she did not see ANON_NAME_0, she was not sure that the baby was alive. Suddenly, her live had turned into darkness, sadness, and unhappiness. After several hours, one doctor came into Paty's room and told her that the baby was born with Spina Bifida, a developmental birth defect. She was in shock! She could not believe her ears and got depressed. One nurse told her that the baby would not live for a long time and that she had to be aware of that fact. Can you imagine how she felt? After a month, she came back home with her baby and a broken heart.

ANON_NAME_0's days were passing full of visits to the hospital. At some point she was having operations every week. One day, I went to visit Paty and I could not recognize her, that positive and happy person was gone. The whole family was feeling the same pain as her. I began to help her, but that was not enough. She needed time to recover from this experience. ANON_NAME_0's behavior was the opposite of Paty's. She was a happy baby, smiling, laughing, and growing. She began to talk and every time someone was with her she said, ""I love you"". The first time that I heard her saying that I could not believe it. 

Gradually, Paty began to feel the life that ANON_NAME_0 had inside and she changed her attitude. She began to smile and little by little her life returned to the feelings of that happiness, almost in the way that it was before ANON_NAME_0's birth. ANON_NAME_0 was a special little one; she was an angel for us. She taught us about love, life, and faith. She had that 'spirit of fight' that we need in life to go through big 'problems'. She had problems walking but all the time she said: ""I want to walk"". We pretended that she was walking and her face was radiant. I can see it until now. Every day was a new challenge for both, Paty and ANON_NAME_0, but they knew how to face them. After three years of a 'stable' medical situation, ANON_NAME_0's immune system had weakened and the doctors did not know what to do. A simple flu could kill her. When ANON_NAME_0 was three and a half years old, she got Meningitis. For one month, she was fighting for her life. However, the infection increased every day. Finally, she died.

I was there when she died. Paty was screaming! She hugged ANON_NAME_0 and I hugged Paty and told her ""let her go, it is time."" The world around us turned from light to darkness as the whole family felt my sister's lost. Looking back over the last ten years, Paty recovered from this experience. During those years, she gained insight into the great, an unexpected gift that ANON_NAME_0 was to her. Her smile was radiant, her ""I love you"" was deep, her desire for walking was strong, and her sweetest was also present. All these qualities of ANON_NAME_0 gave Paty LIFE.

Now, we can see the beautiful gift that we received. We learn that you don't know what life is going to give you, but whatever it is, you need to accept it. Some experiences are hard or painful. While some experiences are easy or joyful. Some can be 'unexpected', but the attitude that you have is the key for your happiness. I truly believe that every day we receive 'unexpected gifts'. Be aware and enjoy it.

When ANON_NAME_0 was three and a half years old, she got Meningitis. For one month, she was fighting for her life. However, the infection increased every day. Finally, she died. I was there when she died. Paty was screaming! She hugged ANON_NAME_0 and I hugged Paty and told her ""let her go, it is time."" The world around us turned from light to darkness as the whole family felt my sister's lost. Looking back over the last ten years, Paty recovered from this experience. During those years, she gained insight into the great, an unexpected gift that ANON_NAME_0 was to her. Her smile was radiant, her ""I love you"" was deep, her desire for walking was strong, and her sweetest was also present. All these qualities of ANON_NAME_0 gave Paty LIFE. Now, we can see the beautiful gift that we received. We learn that you don't know what life is going to give you, but whatever it is, you need to accept it. Some experiences are hard or painful. While some experiences are easy or joyful. Some can be 'unexpected', but the attitude that you have is the key for your happiness. I truly believe that every day we receive 'unexpected gifts'. Be aware and enjoy it. ","After her daughter was born, her life turned into a whirlwind. She was overwhelmed by her plethora of feelings; she could not deal with these feelings for a long time. She knew that her life had been changed forever. Paty had always been a very positive and happy person. She is my oldest sister and a very good friend of mine. She was expecting her second baby. The whole family was waiting for that day with a lot of joy. The day arrived. It was a beautiful spring day. She went to the hospital, and after many hours of labor, the baby was born. She was the most beautiful girl that I have never seen. However, something was wrong. As soon as the baby was born, the doctors took the baby to another room for examination. However, Paty was taken back to her room. That was unexpected. She asked around what was happening, but she received no answer. She started to cry, she was scared, and she knew that something very bad was happening. While Paty was trying to calm herself, the doctors were running back and forth performing multiple tests on ANON_NAME_0. Paty was desperate. No one wanted to answer her questions. Since she did not see ANON_NAME_0, she was not sure that the baby was alive. Suddenly, her live had turned into darkness, sadness, and unhappiness. After several hours, one doctor came into Paty's room and told her that the baby was born with Spina Bifida, a developmental birth defect. She was in shock! She could not believe her ears and got depressed. One nurse told her that the baby would not live for a long time and that she had to be aware of that fact. Can you imagine how she felt? After a month, she came back home with her baby and a broken heart. ANON_NAME_0's days were passing full of visits to the hospital. At some point she was having operations every week. One day, I went to visit Paty and I could not recognize her, that positive and happy person was gone. The whole family was feeling the same pain as her. I began to help her, but that was not enough. She needed time to recover from this experience. ANON_NAME_0's behavior was the opposite of Paty's. She was a happy baby, smiling, laughing, and growing. She began to talk and every time someone was with her she said, ""I love you"". The first time that I heard her saying that I could not believe it. Gradually, Paty began to feel the life that ANON_NAME_0 had inside and she changed her attitude. She began to smile and little by little her life returned to the feelings of that happiness, almost in the way that it was before ANON_NAME_0's birth. ANON_NAME_0 was a special little one; she was an angel for us. She taught us about love, life, and faith. She had that 'spirit of fight' that we need in life to go through big 'problems'. She had problems walking but all the time she said: ""I want to walk"". We pretended that she was walking and her face was radiant. I can see it until now. Every day was a new challenge for both, Paty and ANON_NAME_0, but they knew how to face them. After three years of a 'stable' medical situation, ANON_NAME_0's immune system had weakened and the doctors did not know what to do. A simple flu could kill her.

The first thing to do is get the 'Masa.' You can buy it in a special place called 'tortilleria' or you can buy Tamales mix already prepared. Put the 'Masa' in a bowl and add shortening(can be vegetable or pork), salt to taste and mix until the dough is smooth.
When the 'Masa' is ready, put it into the cornhusks and spread it. Next, add the filling. The filling are the most important ingredient because it give flavor to the tamales. You can prepare meat, chicken,vegetables,beans or something sweet like raisins or strawberries.
For the feeling I usually prepare chicken with vegetables. In a pot put chicken, potatoes,squashes and carrots and cook it until the chicken is well-done. Add salt to taste and fill the 'masa.' Now are ready to cook. Use a steamer and cook it for one hour or two. The time depends of the quantity and the size of the tamal so you can check after an hour and see if are done.
Finally you can add beans side to the tamales and salsa and sour cream on the top.

","In Mexico we have a lot of different holidays and each one has a special food. Each state has a characteristic meal. My favorite holiday meal is ""tamales.""

If you don't have enough knowledge today, you should study in the school and become a student. So you must choose the different types of schools, you would become different type's student. As we know, according to the different ages and culture of students, the types of students are divided into three types: the primary student, the middle school student, and the college student.
The first type of student is the primary student who is youngest. When you are 6 years old, you should study in grade 1 in the primary school by the law in China. There are 6 grades in the primary school. The age of the students is usually from 6 to 12. You would study the basic knowledge. For example, you major in native language, foreign languages, math, music, gym, drawing and science, but the knowledge is relatively simple. Through studying, it could make you know daily life knowledge and the use of basic language. So it is important for you to make the strong basis of the knowledge in the primary school.
The second type of student is the middle school student who is younger. After graduating from the primary school, you should go to the middle school. There are 6 grades in the middle school, which is divided into two periods: junior middle school and high school. When you are in the junior school, you should receive the secondary education, and begin to study some subjects, such as chemistry, physics, secondary math and native language and foreign language, which are more intricate for you to study than them in the primary school. Especially, there is the most important period in the high school because you should pass the college entrance exam after graduating from the high school. During the high school, it is tough for you to study for the college entrance exam, and there is too much homework to do every day. When you succeed in the college entrance exam, you can enter the college.
The third type of student is the college student who is young and receives the high education. It is divided into two groups: the undergraduate and grad student. Fist of all, when you become an undergraduate at a four-year college or university, you would major in some field, such as math, biology, chemistry, physics, literature, history, economics, music. When you graduate, you would receive a degree- probably a B.A. or B.S., depending on your major. If you who continue your study after graduation are in graduate school, you are a grad student. You are in a master's program or a doctoral program. After two more years, you would receive a master's degree-probably an M.A., M.S., M.B.A., or M.F.A. If you attend for three or more years, you would get a Ph.D. This is the highest university degree. In addition, there is spare time that you could attend in college or university, such as a short term or evening university.
Today, it is rapidly developing age in the science and technology, you must master enough knowledge in order to keep up with the times, and you could work well in the society. So you should unceasingly study, and you would choose one type in accordance with different characteristics of above those types. In general, when you become a college student, including undergraduate and grad student, you would have a bright future after graduating.

School is a small society. Students are the majority in schools. Every student has his/her abilities and potential for learning. Students can be classified into three groups: genius, normal students, and below average students.

First, some students have an unusually high level of intelligence as we said they are genius. They have special gifts that make them have higher understanding to learn new skills. For instance, they learn new skills quickly, and they are very talented on learning without spending too much time; instead they do have spare time to think about and figure out new theories, inventions or puzzles. For example, Einstein was probably the greatest mathematical genius of all time that equations of special relativity, E = mc2 , is the incredible theory in the world. Newton figured out the gravity theory and created Newton's law of motion. Therefore, they always have the ideas that normal people can not think of.

Second, most of students are in average and normal that means they have the same IQ or level on learning abilities. Only they work hard to improve themselves to achieve their goals. For example, these students put the certain amount efforts to get better grades. In addition, the more you work harder, the more feedbacks you got. These students barely have fancy ideas in their heads. On the other hand, they are down to earth, such as if you want to get good grades or good performance at your academic work; you have to plan on daily study. However, it is possible for them to have excellent academic scores if they do work hard.

Lastly, a few students have disabilities on learning and they are usually below average. Some of them truly are mental challenged that they can not learn skills very well. For instance, people with Alzheimer's disease have lower mental demand, and they can not think properly. However, those learning disabilities students often have a big heart and patient on education. On the contrary, some students who don't have any learning disorders, but they can not accomplish learning. The possible reason is they are just being lazy to learn and discover knowledge. They have lower learning desires to enhance themselves.

Overall, these three kinds of students: genius, normal students, and below average students are we normally we can see in schools.

 Different people have different habits. In my point of view, some of them have very bad habits. Some people have the habit of always bothering other people. Parents may spoil their children and make them have a lot of harmful habits. Students also have a lot of horrible habits.
 First of all, some people have the habit of bothering other peoples. One illustration is when someone smokes in the public places it will be bothersome to the surrounding women and children. Another example is to talk to your friends with full mouth or while biting a nail or pencil. 
 Secondly, parents might spoil their children and make them have a lot of harmful habits. Some parents let their babies to sleep with them, which might make their children to become excessively dependent on them. Others allow their children eat a lot of junk food like candies, chips, chocolate and ice cream. It will hurt their children's health. Some parents also don't want their children to do house cleaning, cook, or wash clothes, and this will make it hard for their children to live alone when they grow up. If they don't know to do the basic housework, how can they live a colorful life?
Finally, students also have a lot of horrible habits. One example is to wait until the deadline to do their homework. Some become so addicted to playing video games overnight that they sleep in class. These things certainly will not help them get a good grade.
 All in all, different people have different bad habits. If you are in that situation, in my opinion, you need to notice them and get rid of them. It will help you to be more successful in your whole life.

Some become so addicted to playing video games overnight that they sleep in class. These things certainly will not help them get a good grade. All in all, different people have different bad habits. If you are in that situation, in my opinion, you need to notice them and get rid of them. It will help you to be more successful in your whole life.","Different people have different habits. In my point of view, some of them have very bad habits. Some people have the habit of always bothering other people. Parents may spoil their children and make them have a lot of harmful habits. Students also have a lot of horrible habits. First of all, some people have the habit of bothering other peoples. One illustration is when someone smokes in the public places it will be bothersome to the surrounding women and children. Another example is to talk to your friends with full mouth or while biting a nail or pencil. Secondly, parents might spoil their children and make them have a lot of harmful habits. Some parents let their babies to sleep with them, which might make their children to become excessively dependent on them. Others allow their children eat a lot of junk food like candies, chips, chocolate and ice cream. It will hurt their children's health.

 First of all, we can think about ball games or sports like soccer and basket ball. Of course, players use the ball. For example, as we know, soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world. Among the two teams, the team which succeed more goals during ninety minutes and extra minutes will win the game. Each team consists of eleven players and there is one break time after forty minutes have gone. Another the ball sport is basket ball. It is known well that basket ball sport players of U.S are very strong and the quality of the game is much higher than any other countries in the world. Each team has five players and it is possible to use break time whenever the coach wants during the playing time. The interesting thing is soccer players can't use their hands at all but basket ball players should use only their hands although they are both ball sports.
 Secondly, I'd like talk about running sports. For instance, marathon and short running race like 100m racing game. Both of them players use their physical abilities. The marathon race is very long (42.195km) so the players should control their physical condition to finish the marathon race. And they need sustaining power as well as speed. On the other hand, short running race players don't need the sustaining power. They always challenge human's speed limit. So most significant abilities for racing player are speed and flexibility because they have to start as quickly as possible. There are different things between marathon and short race, and they are sustaining power and speed.
 Thirdly, the aquatic sports use the water. If they don't play in the water it will be another kind of sports. One illustration is swimming. It is the most well known sport in aquatic sports. The swimming players wear very thin and scientific swimming wear to improve their speed in the water. Many players have a race at the same time and the quickest player will win. There are many kinds of races in the swimming game, such as 50m, 100m, and 1500m. And there are four kinds of play types, like free style, back stroke, breast stroke, and butterfly stroke. Another example of aquatic sport is synchronized playing. Players should be gotten both beautiful score and technical score by indicators during three to five playing times. So the player who gets the highest score will win. It looks like skating or aerobic exercise if they don't play in the water. 
 In conclusion, according above this, types of athletics could be classified into three kinds: ball sports, running sports, and aquatic sports.

But a good way to do it can be seeing their scores or grades. In this sense, the students can be divided into three different types: excellent/good students, bad/horrible students and unclassifiable students (this type will be explained later).

The first type is the good or excellent students. Of course, this kind of student gets the best grades every time, in every class or subject. They always have the homework ready, and they really do not seem to have problems or unpleasant surprises. But in this group, you can also separate them into two different subgroups. The first one is the one that involves excellent students, but also with a great character. They are humble, and they try to help other classmates in the best way they know. Their attitude in class is participative, and they allow the rest of the class to participate, too. The second subgroup is the people who are smart and work hard, but their character fails. It means that they are absolutely proud of themselves, or what is worst, they suck up to the teacher and try to show themselves like a wonderful student. Those who are too much proud try to dominate the class, and they can be a big problem for the learning of the rest of the students. 

The second type of students is the bad or horrible students. It is a real fact that they are more than it should be. These students do not do homework, their grades are poor and the improvements are insignificant. Their attitude in class is annoying, and when most of these students are joined in the same group, the correct speed of the lessons and explanations goes down. The rest of the students are disturbed, and as a result this situation drive the teachers mad.

And finally the third type of students, which can be called the unclassifiable type. This group can be divided into two different groups, too. One of them joins those students who are able of get either the best or the worst grades. It depends on the day, the inspiration they have, their motivation the day of the test, etc. They are really smart, (many of the best genius of the History could be included in this group), but they only apply their knowledge whenever they want. And the other group are drastically different, but it must be added in this third type in the sense that they are also unclassifiable. It includes the students that have a good attitude, they work so hard, but unfortunately they are completely lost. They do everything wrong and do not understand nothing at all. When you see one of these students, you can avoid asking by yourself how they got such a level, without any knowledge, to be in the same class that you are, and feeling sadness about them.

The ancient Chinese said: ""A good craftsmanship depends on the use of the right tools."" This means if you want to finish work quickly and perfectly, the tools or the methods that you use are very important. This is definitely very true when it comes to household chores. Although I really love to do all the household chores, washing dishes is one thing that usually drives me crazy. Human-hand washer--washing dishes by hand--is kind of a tradition from my home country, Taiwan, while using dish washers is very common in the United States. Both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Human-hand washer, however, can guarantee the dishes are clean and save water, electricity, and the cost of dish detergent, so I always prefer washing dishes by hand.

Most people will agree using a dishwasher to wash dishes sometimes will end with bad results, such as unclean or dirty spots. This is probably the biggest problem for dishwasher. Human-hand washer, on the other hand, should not have this problem, because when a person washes dishes by hand, he can see if a dish is completely clean or not. Unless a person is careless, Human-hand washer will always make all the dishes cleaner than using a dishwasher.

Most people who like to use dishwasher think when they use dishwasher, they can save a lot of time. This is true because the dishwasher is automatic, so people can do other things they want when the dishes are being washed. Conversely, when they save time, they lose other things. When using a dishwasher, it has many cycles: wash, rinse, and heat. Washing and rinsing cycles use a lot of water, and the heating cycle needs a lot of electricity. Human-hand washer also requires water, but the water can be controlled by each person washing the dishes. In addition, human-hand washer does not require electricity because the dishes can be dried by hand or in air. Finally, using the dishwasher or Human-hand washer both need dish soap or dish detergent. However, dishwasher detergent usually costs more than normal dish detergent, and the amount of dish detergent can be controlled when washing by hand. This can save a lot of money after a long time.

I really believe in washing all the dishes by hand. I always want to make sure all the dishes are clean, so if using dishwasher sometimes can still have dirty spots on dishes, I will still choose washing dishes by hand. When I wash dishes by hand, I can also save a lot of money by saving water, electricity, and I do not have to buy more expensive dishwasher detergent. Overall, washing dishes by hand is a lot better than using dishwashers. Therefore, I will always be a human-hand washer when there are dishes waiting for me in the kitchen sink!

When I wash dishes by hand, I can also save a lot of money by saving water, electricity, and I do not have to buy more expensive dishwasher detergent. Overall, washing dishes by hand is a lot better than using dishwashers. Therefore, I will always be a human-hand washer when there are dishes waiting for me in the kitchen sink!",3,

 It is apparently that Americans are much different from the Chinese people in appearance, however, do they"" Maybe these two peoples are much similar than most people's thinking when the surface differences are ignored.
 First of all, American and Chinese peoples share very similar diet habits. American, for example, is one of the most meat-favor-people, which means most Americans like all kinds of meat cuisines. A representative and very typical dish on American's dinning table would be the steak. On the other side of the planet, while Americans are chewing their thick juicy steak, Chinese people are enjoying fish or pork dishes. Interestingly, these two peoples also share similar cooking hobbies. When a steak is ready to serve, Americans butter the steak to enrich the taste, and a steak, of course, is also served with greasy side dishes, such as French fires and the Texas rose, or the Texas style onion ring. In contrast, Chinese people stew their favorite pork chops in heavy oil condition. These porker chops are pre-fried with flour-coating and stewed in souse, leading to a juicy and strong flavored taste. Even the best Chinese chefs are well trained to reduce that greasy taste by using amazing side dishes, such as pickled cucumber, the pork chop still contains high fat and obstructs blood vessels efficiently just like the steak platter.
 Another similarity is these two peoples like similar entertainments in general. Today, gambling affair has become the hottest money-making-business in the United States, because of the prior success in the casino city, the Las Vegas. Nowadays, thirty eight states in the U.S. have authorized the legalizations of gambling. Even the most conservative states have started changing their minds about gambling. In 2004, Pennsylvania, for instance, has tasted the sweetness of gambling business because of the trial of slot machine. Only fourteen spots in Pennsylvania are allowed to set up slot machines; however, the business is too good to believe. Hence, the conservative state government and the authorities of cities in Pennsylvania are fighting for opening more and more spots for gambling to improve the financial dilemmas of cities, such as Pittsburgh. In comparison, through the return of the Macau special administrative region which was a small island ruled by Portugal, China has processed the fastest ATM machine of the world. According to the latest business report, the revenue of gambling business in Las Vegas has been dethroned by that in Macau in 2006. Further, the World Tourism Organization says that the Macau region is expected to receive between 24 and 25 million visitors in 2007. Most visitors are considered to be Chinese people, and they go to Macau for only one purpose, gambling. Today, the authority of mainland China does not only taste sweetness of gambling business but also they have to deal with the side effects, such as increasing criminal rate. That is, the casinos are confined on the small island, because the government of China knows that the Chinese people can not control the natural obligation toward gambling.
In conclusion, Americans and Chinese people are very similar in the culinary styles they like and the entertainments they have. Maybe, they still have many similarities people do not notice. In fact, if we keep traveling, we might realize that the differences among different colors, races, and counties are not as obvious as our thinking. Because we are all human beings, we should not allow the impropriate prejudices to narrow our minds. For a better world, we can stop discrimination together.

Both University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) and The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) are public universities of Pennsylvania. We tend to make an easy judge on these two schools' libraries: there is no big difference between them. However, after I moved to Pittsburgh from Penn State and I go to Hillman Library of Pitt very often. I gradually feel compelled to compare it with Pattee and Paterno Library of Penn State in three aspects: hardware, software and atmosphere. Frankly, a library is very complicated and it is related to a large number of aspects. Here what I compare is just covered by my current study activities in these two libraries. 
One important difference is hardware. As far as hardware of a library is involved here, it includes the library building, its structure and the arrangement of assistant function parts in it. The building of Hillman Library is like a cube and very magnificent. Nearly all its assistant function parts are located in its center, including stairways, elevators and water fountains. On the other hand, Pattee and Paterno Library of Penn State is composed of two separate rectangular buildings. Its accessory functional parts, such as restrooms and stairways are hidden from people's easy sights. On the surface, the Pattee and Paterno Library is not outgoing and very commonly decorated. The different space arrangement of two libraries makes them very remarkably different to readers. On the outside, Hillman Library looks very large. Actually a large amount of of its inside space is wasted by its particular structure. It is obviously smaller than Pattee and Paterno Library. In Hillman Library, at least half of the seats are without power sockets. But in the Pattee and Paterno Library, readers can easily find a socket close to their seats. Another point is that the space above the desk in Hillman Library is not high enough to fit an unfolding laptop very well. But there is no problem like this in Pattee and Paterno Library.
Another difference is software. Here software of a library refers to its book collection and internet service. Hillman Library has 4,908,913 monograph volumes, 50,232 current serials received and 7543846 microfilm materials. On the other hand, Pattee and Paterno Library has 5,031,196 monograph volumes, 68,445 current serials received and 5,202,694 microfilms. Hillman library has more electronic version books and journals. Pattee and Paterno Library has more books in the engineering, science, business and law. But Hillman Library has much more books in medicine than Pattee and Paterno Library. Especially the East Asian Library of Hillman Library holds much more books in eastern Asia language the Pattee and Paterno Library. In addition, wireless internet signal in Hillman Library is extremely unstable, so readers cannot make a working internet connection, which discourages readers to use laptops. While Pattee and Paterno Library, wireless service has been put into practice for several years and there is no problem related to wireless signal.
Finally, atmosphere is an important aspect for readers. Here the atmosphere of a library means whatever encourages or discourages people to study in it. Atmosphere determines the library of a university is a comfortable place for studying or not. The furniture in Hillman Library looks worn out, especially the chairs and open stacks, which give readers a desolated feeling. Its windows are not clean and the blinds don't work well at all, which distract readers' attention from books. Randomly using cell phone by some readers makes other readers freaking out when they focus on their work. Reading seats and computer seats are open. Readers are easily distracted by pass-bys. While in Pattee and Paterno Library, furniture has an enduring surface, which is attractive for reader to take a seat and start reading. Clean carpet and clear windows and other related parts working very well further comfort readers to stay in the library. Also there is easily noticeable sign to remind readers of a place in it that is a permitted area for cell phone service. All seats for reading and using computers are well separated by barriers. In addition, Hillman Library is very noisy because its main stairwell is arranged in the center of the building and the bumping sound of doors is very loud. In the third floor and fourth floor, the floor is paved with hard-surface plastic bricks. When readers drag and move chairs, they frequently make a very annoying noise which affects others' reading severely. Or readers' steps on them can produce a big sound. However, in Pattee and Paterno Library, all seats are arranged far away from common areas. And all floors are covered with carpet. So it keeps very quiet. 
I was happy to read that ""Among the elite research libraries in North America, Pitt's library system ranks in the top 25 in total materials, ahead of such other prestigious institutions as Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, Dartmouth and MIT."" from director of the University Library System at the University of Pittsburgh. However, the differences between these two libraries I listed above could direct me to draw a conclusion: there is a lot of room for Pitt to improve its library for readers if it hopes Hillman Library to be representative of its academic level.

However, the differences between these two libraries I listed above could direct me to draw a conclusion: there is a lot of room for Pitt to improve its library for readers if it hopes Hillman Library to be representative of its academic level.

 There are a lot of rival sports teams in the world. For example, the Boston Red sox & the New York Yankees, the Real Madrid & the Barcelona, the Manchester United & the Arsenal and the LA Dodgers & the San Francisco Giant are announced renowned rival teams. Fans do not like each other when their rival team plays a game opposite other rival team. Moreover, they refuse see each other during playing game. Actually, I am at the Boston Red Sox fan, I always interested in the article which is related to the Red Sox and the Yankees. Even though there two teams look nothing in common, they have several similarities: popular teams both of them in the U.S, relating to Babe Ruth and Having good players and coach.

 First of all, both of them are popular teams in the U.S. the Red Sox found in 1901 and they have been a strong team in American League for a long time. Also, they have a lot of fans in the U.S even Japan and Korea. During baseball season, you can easily watch the Red Sox game by TV, because a big broadcasting station such as Fox or ABC gets a high program rating. Also, the Boston Red Sox for getting fans made their broadcasting station. The Yankees is also one of the popular team in the U.S. In the survey of ""ESPN"" which is a sports channel, the Yankees is the most popular them in the U.S. Yankees has been great team and got a lot of World Series Championship. They found in 1901 like the Red Sox. If you travel in the U.S cities, you can see people who wear the cap of the Yankees logo everywhere. People want to watch the Yankees games because they have a lot of stars and plays well, hence broadcasting station want to broadcast Yankees game. They also have their broadcasting station name of ""YES"". 

 Second, both of them relate to Babe Ruth who was the greatest baseball star in the baseball history. Even though Babe Ruth was renowned a Yankees star, at first, he had played in the Boston Red Sox. When he was playing in Boston, he was good pitcher and batter. Because of him, the Boston Red Sox could win many games. At that time, the Boston Red Sox got World Series Championship as many as four times. Unfortunately, executive people of the Red Sox decided to sell Babe Ruth to the Yankees for building new stadium name of ""Pen Way Park"". Since then the Boston Red Sox had not gotten World Series Championship for 86 years old. However, the New York Yankees has gotten World Series Championship as many as 26 times since Babe Ruth was traded from Boston. Since then, people called that ""Bambino's curse."" Whenever people talk about the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, Babe Ruth's story is one of the most important issues. 

 Finally, both of them have a lot of good players and good coaches. In Red Sox, Many ANON_NAME_0, David ANON_NAME_1, Josh Becket, Curt Schering and Mike Lowell are famous stars in the Major League Baseball. A lot of people buy a ticket to see them. Terry Franconia, who is a Red Sox coach, is great coach. He finished 'Bambino's curse? two years ago. He controls well his team. For making popular team, owner of the Boston Red Sox always invests a lot of money. Yankees has also a lot of good players and good coach. Derik Jeter, A-rod, Julio Posada, Jason Jiambi and Mariano Rivera are very famous players. Joe Torre, who is a Yankees coach, is one of the greatest coaches in Major League Baseball history. He got three times World Series Champion Ship. Yankees owner also invests a lot of money for his team. 

 In conclusion, although the Red Sox & the Yankees look nothing in common and dislike each others, there are remarkable similarities popular teams both of them in the U.S, relating to Babe Ruth and Having good players and good coach. In the Red sox fan's point, having rival team is good for me because it gives me more interesting and enjoy it. I can not imagine the Red sox without the Yankees.

 Most of us schedule our day whether we do it consciously or unconsciously. Everyday, as soon as we wake up, we are already busy planning all our activities for the day. Usually as we go to bed, we continue to think and plan our activities for the following day. This routine continues everyday.

Furthermore, some people are checking their car for best conditions and preparing a checklist to pack their baggage the night before. Being prepared means prevention of the least problems and unexpected events. We are doing all of these to avoid any unexpected or unnecessary events that might be happen.

 However, we all have experiences about not keeping our schedules or plans. Sometimes we are too exhausted to do them as it is planned. Sometimes we want time for ourselves or want do as it is not planned. That is why some people prefer making no plans for a trip.

 In conclusion, we are living in a modern society. The system of the society is changing so quickly and all is planned. We are accustomed to it but this matter makes people sometimes exhausting.

Have you seen people who are eating a monkey brain in a country? If you see them, you would be shocked. However, a monkey brain could be the country's traditional food. That is why it is not unusual for people who live in the country to eat it. Similarly, when I came to the U.S, I had to encounter difficulty adapting to American culture because I was born in Korea and had lived there for almost my whole life. It means I did not know about American culture at all. I have lived with American family for 10 months, so I have been adapting to American culture. If I do everything with a Korean way and thinking in my house, my host family would not want to live with me. While I have been dealing with the culture shock, I have been able to find differences between the U.S and Korea in terms of eating habit, clothing, and fundamental value. 
One difference is eating habit between the U.S and Korea. When Koreans eat food, they use chopsticks and a spoon. They always eat rice and soup at mealtimes. Also, they arrange side dishes in a table, and then they start to pick up the dishes with chopsticks. On the other hand, Americans usually use a folk and knife, and they do not have main food. For example, they could eat a piece of bread, potato, and chicken for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In other words, the main food does not exist in the U.S. Also, they pass around plates, which include the food, to a person next to them after they arrange food.
Another difference is clothing. Koreans tend to judge people with what people wear. For instance, if a man wears clothes which are made by expensive and famous brand, Koreans will have a good image about him. In contrast, Americans do not care no matter what people wear. They usually wear casual clothes. It means that they prefer to wear comfortable clothes than expensive ones. They sometimes take T-shirts off when they feel hot. Unlike them, Koreans do not do that because showing body to other people outside is impolite for them. For example, when I saw bikini girls in the park who lied down on the grass, I was shocked. At that time, they seemed like that they did not care whoever saw them.
The big difference between the U.S and Korea is fundamental value. Respect to older people is crucial for Koreans. They have two different ways to speak Korean. One is a way for speaking to older people, and another one is a way for speaking to people who are same or younger age. For example, they use ""you"" when they call a person who is younger than them or same age. However, they do not use ""you"" when they call a person who is older than them. They have other words which represent older people instead of ""you"". Furthermore, they bow to older people. Surprisingly, even if my friend is 1 year older than me, I bow to my friend. Unlike them, Americans think that everyone from kids to the elderly is equal. Even kids can call the elderly just ""you"". In addition, all of them regardless of how old they are use shaking hands to say hello and good bye. 
While I live in the U.S, I have thought that American culture is totally different from Korean culture about eating habit, clothing, and fundamental value. Because I am living and studying in the U.S, I should learn and adapt to American culture. If people want to migrate to a foreign country and study abroad, they should adapt to the country's culture.

 Each person has a preferred place to live. Some people want to live in an urban area having many people and convenient businesses around them but other people want to live in a rural area with pristine nature and sparsely populated areas. Since people interact with the environment where they live, the surroundings are crucial aspects to consider. People have been significantly affected by their surroundings. Presumably, the surroundings can influence a habitant's behavior, personality, and mind forming. Thus people choose their place of residence by personal inclination or prior values that they believe important for their life. Regardless of where you live, you can savor advantages in each area and eventually you will adapt to your environment. However, the benefits and effects in those areas are very distinctive, so we cannot measure which area is better or worse to live in because both ways have their peculiar characteristics that are incomparable.
 In the first place, the best merit of living in a rural area is the pristine environment. The people who want to live amid the mountain, river, or ocean try their best to harmonize with their environment. They avoid harming the environment as best as they can because they came to nature to stay away from artificial life. Having an idyllic life seems their ultimate goal. Despite having inconveniences such as a long drive to buy the necessities of life, attend cultural events, such as movies, galleries, and sporting events, their back yard could be regarded as an organic farm where they plant vegetables with absolutely no agricultural chemicals. Also, the natural phenomena that happen around their neighborhood are the most dramatic movies in the world. For instance, experiencing the four seasons in nature could not be compared with any spectacle movie. None of the movies can perfectly describe the intrinsic value of the natural changes in the four seasons such as leaf buds and birds' singing in spring, green forest and the glaring sun of summer, mighty nature's exquisite canvas of beautiful fall foliage and the brisk wind of fall, and the immaculate white snow in winter. Furthermore, you can see millions of stars and endless sky with bare eyes every night. If you live in nature, your walking becomes a therapeutic walk in the forest and if you grow vegetables, those become organic vegetables. 
 In the second place, the majority of the world's population lives in urban areas because our society is becoming more sophisticated and civilized. These people build schools, hospitals, and many other businesses to ease their life. They can access the newest technologies and information very easily and having this social infrastructure helps people live comfortably. Breaking from primitive life, they formed society. Living together makes people's lives significantly more convenient. Although, they might lack trees, vast prairies, and fresh air, their industrialized society outweighs these deficits. The urban area is the place where you can do everything whenever you want to due to its accessibility. For example, you can order Mexican food at midnight with a single phone call, or you can buy fish even though you are living far away from the ocean. In addition, you can use advanced technical devices such as GPS, PDA, and wireless internet service. Moreover, they can have a great many different kinds of pleasure by spending time with other people. Since people are defined as social animals, they can share their interest by interacting with each other. People enjoy watching sports teams and rooting for the same team together or they can attend a book club or dance club to socialize.
 Conclusively, people choose their environment of residence according to their prior value for quality of life. Some people want to live near nature to relish mighty nature's amazing faces, while other people want to live in an urban area appreciating the facilities of civilization. However, neither living situation can be complete with just one side. In other words, none of us can live by merely urban life or rural life. People in rural areas need places to buy essentials for living and people in urban areas need places to relax and refresh. Thus, at a certain point, these lives have a premise of mutual complement.

They avoid harming the environment as best as they can because they came to nature to stay away from artificial life. Having an idyllic life seems their ultimate goal. Despite having inconveniences such as a long drive to buy the necessities of life, attend cultural events, such as movies, galleries, and sporting events, their back yard could be regarded as an organic farm where they plant vegetables with absolutely no agricultural chemicals. Also, the natural phenomena that happen around their neighborhood are the most dramatic movies in the world. For instance, experiencing the four seasons in nature could not be compared with any spectacle movie. None of the movies can perfectly describe the intrinsic value of the natural changes in the four seasons such as leaf buds and birds' singing in spring, green forest and the glaring sun of summer, mighty nature's exquisite canvas of beautiful fall foliage and the brisk wind of fall, and the immaculate white snow in winter. Furthermore, you can see millions of stars and endless sky with bare eyes every night. If you live in nature, your walking becomes a therapeutic walk in the forest and if you grow vegetables, those become organic vegetables. In the second place, the majority of the world's population lives in urban areas because our society is becoming more sophisticated and civilized. These people build schools, hospitals, and many other businesses to ease their life. They can access the newest technologies and information very easily and having this social infrastructure helps people live comfortably. Breaking from primitive life, they formed society. Living together makes people's lives significantly more convenient. Although, they might lack trees, vast prairies, and fresh air, their industrialized society outweighs these deficits. The urban area is the place where you can do everything whenever you want to due to its accessibility. For example, you can order Mexican food at midnight with a single phone call, or you can buy fish even though you are living far away from the ocean. In addition, you can use advanced technical devices such as GPS, PDA, and wireless internet service. Moreover, they can have a great many different kinds of pleasure by spending time with other people. Since people are defined as social animals, they can share their interest by interacting with each other. People enjoy watching sports teams and rooting for the same team together or they can attend a book club or dance club to socialize. Conclusively, people choose their environment of residence according to their prior value for quality of life. Some people want to live near nature to relish mighty nature's amazing faces, while other people want to live in an urban area appreciating the facilities of civilization. However, neither living situation can be complete with just one side. In other words, none of us can live by merely urban life or rural life. People in rural areas need places to buy essentials for living and people in urban areas need places to relax and refresh. Thus, at a certain point, these lives have a premise of mutual complement.","Each person has a preferred place to live. Some people want to live in an urban area having many people and convenient businesses around them but other people want to live in a rural area with pristine nature and sparsely populated areas. Since people interact with the environment where they live, the surroundings are crucial aspects to consider. People have been significantly affected by their surroundings. Presumably, the surroundings can influence a habitant's behavior, personality, and mind forming. Thus people choose their place of residence by personal inclination or prior values that they believe important for their life. Regardless of where you live, you can savor advantages in each area and eventually you will adapt to your environment. However, the benefits and effects in those areas are very distinctive, so we cannot measure which area is better or worse to live in because both ways have their peculiar characteristics that are incomparable.

 ""All I ask of you~~"" With sweet melodies, my eyes are closed and my heart is freely floating. If you have a little concern about musical, you would hear the name of a world famous musical ""the phantom of the opera"". It was a French novel by Gaston Lenoux and was translated in English and made to a performance, movie and play. After that, an American director Andrew Loyd Webber depicted it to a musical in 1986, and it has been known the best successful musical of Broadway until now. Actually I didn't have a chance to watch the earlier type of this musical but I had a precious experience of watching this one in musical and in movie - was made in 2004 by Joel schumacher- in 2005. As watching these two types of the performance, I could get unforgettable impression and compare these two types in the performance and the circumstance.

 In the performance aspect, we can consider several strong and weak points in musical and movie. The strongest aspect of watching musical is that we can watch in front of the stage, as facing to the actors and actresses. Every stage and performance has its own character and color in a base of the playing music and songs at that time. The audience can be touched by the lively vivid performance in the seats. However, the environment of the seats are not same condition to enjoy; some of them are close to the stage, so the people in the seats can enjoy the performance totally, but some of them are too far from the stage, so the people in the seats can not recognize even the expression of the actors/actresses nor the detail effects of the stage. These limitations can disturb the impression. In addition, there is a limitation of the stage. Even though the technology of the performance has been developed, the stage is just one or two of a musical theater. With this number of the stage, the expression of all the background in the stage is clearly impossible. Moreover, the variety of the performance - every performance is difference- can be a weak point to watching as well as a strong point. For an audience, the chance to watch the musical is only one time, but when the only chance was worse than usual performance, the memory of the audience would be lasting as a bad experience. In contrast, the movie provides recording music and songs all the time. Even though people can not feel the lively expressed music, they can recognize the facial action of the characters and every detail expression of the stages through the screen. Most of all, movie doesn't have any limitation of expression in describe the stages, it can jump to the other places and even to the past and future. This lack of the limitation can lead the audience to fall in the story more than the musical. Also, because the director made the movie just one time with lots of fund, the first investment was enough. The director could spend money to hire skillful orchestra, players and editor to make better sound effect. Hence, this qualified sound is always ready to play for the audiences.

 Besides the differences in the performances, we can find other differences in the circumstance. When we want to watch the musical, we, first, should go to Broadway where the musical has been playing. If you are living near Broadway, it would not be a problem, but most of the audiences are living in the other cities or countries, so it can be a big challenge to the people in time and budget aspect. The price of the ticket also can be an obstacle to watch the musical. Since the average price is over $70, people must set a time to go to the musical theater and the number of watching should be limited. Further, because the performance does not repeat, even if we want to watch it again, the other performance can not be same one we watched. On the other hand, there are a lot of movie theaters in most of cities, so we just pick a theater and spend a little time to go there. It is the superb usefulness of movie. Also, the price of ticket is very cheap compare with one of musical. These two things make the movie be accessible more than musical. In addition, after watching the movie, we can purchase DVD title easily to contain the work for a long time and can watch any time repeatedly. 

 Musical, it must have its own affinity to allure people with the lively played music in front of the audiences. However, people can contact to the movie work more easily, enjoy the detail performance with relatively cheap price, and also keep the same work in personally. Therefore, unless you have a chance to go to Broadway, I'd like to recommend going to the movie theater to enjoy high quality performance. As same matter you can keep the work as a DVD title when you like the performance.

Wikipedia defines art as ""a human activity, made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind; by transmitting emotions and/or ideas.""
There are many different forms of art humans use to express themselves. Poetry and Music are two forms of art that share many similarities.
 
Poetry expresses feelings through metaphors. A metaphor is a way of describing something by calling it something else; for example, ""The princess is a shining jewel"" or ""excitement"" can be expressed as ""a storm."" These concepts are then linked into a full story. Such stories can have additional structural properties. Two examples of these properties are metric and rhyme. To have a specific metric, the story is divided into paragraphs of equal number of lines. Rhyme, on the other hand, makes the sound of the ending of the lines the same (or the sound of the last words). 

Because poetry is something unique each poet creates its own style sharing this style in his creations of beauty. Poems are the result of a complex process of discovery of feelings that generate new ideas at the very moment of the writing. Because poems are abstract, they can be both difficult to write and to understand. The understanding of a poem is not the most important issue but the appreciation of the new ideas, feelings, and experiences the poet is trying to communicate. 
 
Music, on the other hand, is basically a concatenation of sounds into what is called a melody. This melody also evokes feelings as poetry does. Metric is also used in these melodies to structure it in coordinated time intervals. Besides metric, harmony is another property of the music that defines the smooth transitions between the sounds to make them amenable to the ear. 
 
Music, as poetry, has many styles. Different styles of music like rock, classic, and pop provoke different feelings. Music can engage the listener into different additional activities such as singing or dancing.
 
Although poetry and music are unique expressions of Art, both evoke feelings and have similar structural features such as metric and others particular to each other, such as rhyme in the case of poetry and harmony in the case of music. However, they use different elements, poetry uses words and music uses sounds. 
 
Nevertheless, it is important to remember that poetry and music are art expressions that share more similarities than the ones we can see at first sight. This is why I love poetry and music.

To make a simple but useful outline, you should use numbers or symbols, such as I, 1. (1) and a. It means you can narrow down your essay at the same time. You should also make introduction, bodies, and conclusion. In ordinary a good essay has five paragraphs including from introduction to conclusion. 
 When you finish making outline, you can start your first writing. If you add your own experiences or suitable examples at this time, it is very helpful for audiences to understand your essay. I think that it is an exactly good essay what audiences can understand your meaning throughout your essay.
 As soon as you finish your first writing, you have to revise it. Because it is impossible to write perfect essay at the first time, it is essential step for a good essay.

How many hours a day do you spend on the Internet? Have you even thought what you could do if you did not have the Internet? I think no one can deny that the Internet has dramatically changed people's lives. Without the Internet, people's lives would be boring. Nowadays, people rely on the Internet for fun, work and being relaxing. The Internet brings people the convenience to gather information, helps people deal with problems, and provides people chances to communicate with friends.

First of all, the Internet brings people the convenience to gather information. Before the development of the Internet, people looked up the information they needed in books, journals, magazines or newspapers. They had to spend a lot of time finding the reference materials. Also, they might need to stay at libraries a whole day. Now, however, we just need to sit in front of computers and we can find out various information. For example, I had a lot of assignments and papers during my university life. I always found helpful materials online. I just typed what I needed online, and then related information would be displayed. The related information had many opinions which helped me to create new ideas. Due to space, materials are constrained at the libraries. The materials at libraries are not as many as those on the Internet. Therefore, the Internet not only finds information easily but also saves people a lot of time. 

In addition, the Internet helps people deal with problems. People might be busy, so they do not have much time to deal with problems in their life. Because of this, more and more companies supply online service gradually. We can make a reservation online, we can make payments online, and we can shop online as well. For instance, I need to deal with several bills every month. I change my paper bills to be electric bills if possible. After getting the bills, I just need to make payments through the online payment system of the bank. The system will transfer the fee to the companies for me the day I select. I will not worry about which day is the due date, and also I do not have to send the checks to companies every month. It also saves me money and time. 

Last, the Internet provides people with opportunities to contact friends easily and make different kinds of friends. At present, people are so busy working that they overlook contacting their friends. Now, people might be able to contact friends or get their friends' news through blogs or e-mails. Even though people do not contact their friends often, they still could share their pictures or life with their friends. Also, the Internet can facilitate to make new friends who have different backgrounds and cultures from you. People can meet other various people in chat rooms. They can share their different lives, cultures and hobbies with each other. I like to browse strangers' blogs when I have leisure time. I can experience their special cultures and their ideas by reading their articles or diaries. A few times I left messages for them and they replied to me. It is a good way to meet the different friends. Making different friends is being able to make people widen their minds and lives. 

Nowadays, the Internet is used widely and people rely on it a lot as well. It has already changed people's lives. First, it is a convenient way for people to gather various and diverse information. People can find out the information or materials online instead of at libraries. It also could save people a lot of time. Besides, people can deal with problems, such as bills, online. They do not have to worry about the due date. It saves people a lot of time and avoids a lot of troubles. In addition, the Internet is a good tool for people to keep in touch with friends and make different kinds of new friends. It is easier to keep in touch with friends even if you do not meet him or her often. You can just send a brief email or leave a message. Also, it is a good way to make new friends. Making new friends can make people's lives become richer.

 One of the most important things that changed my life is that I went to China Medical University and Lived with 9 roommates for 5 years. They are my classmates, best friends and sisters. I learned a lot of things from this experience. Like most children in China I am the only child in family. I had never lived with someone who is in my age before I left home for college. In that 5 years I learned what is sharing, what is helping and what is love.
 Sharing is difficult but it is the most magical thing in the world. It brings you more than you give. Before I left home I'd never really share something with other people. I am the princess of my parents. They bought me almost everything I wanted. I don't need to give my toys or books to a younger brother or sister. What is my is mine. However, things become different since I began to live in dormitory. When one of my roommates gave some fruits to me I felt so strange and happy. I knew she may want to be friendly and I was supposed to give something back but I just felt so hard to do that. Actually I was not the only one that had this problem. After one year things became better. I began to like sharing especially when I got some really good things. For instant, When my Mom sent me a lot of chocolate because of my birthday the first thing in my mind was I want everyone feel the love from my Mom. I shared the present from my Mom immediately and became much happier. The five years is forgettable because I found my second family.
 When I began to treat my friends as my family member I hope they never get hurt and I want to help them whenever they need. I still remember the night when one of my roommates was sent to the hospital because of appendicitis. I was so afraid. The other 8 girls and me spent the whole night in the hospital and just want to make sure that everything is good. When the hospital told us that the surgery needs 3000 deposit otherwise they can't do it. We paid it immediately because we knew the life of friend is more important than money. We even didn't think about if she can pay it back at that moment although we know her family is poor. In five years there are many times that someone was sick but no one felt nervous or sad because there are always 9 lovely girls who really loved her and wanted to take care of her.
 The love between my friends and me never end even I left China. After coming to the United States I missed them so much. Actually on the day when I graduated I didn't feel that sad. Maybe because in my heart I hadn't accepted the truth that we wouldn't see each other in a long time. Apparently it looked like a normal vacation that we said goodbye to each other but 1 month later we reunion again. However, when I got home and thought that I may never see some of them again I cried a lot. Now I write to them frequently and hope that one day I can see them again.
 Five years is too short for me to be with 9 good friends. I learned a lot of things from them which I can't learn from book. They helped me to grow up. Although I don't have any siblings I am luckier to have 9 sisters. In the deep of my heart I believe my friendship will never end.

In the past people said that someone who doesn't know how to read or write was ignorant; today people say someone who doesn't know how to use the Internet is ignorant. Therefore it happens nowadays for someone who is very well-educated to be an ignorant based upon this criterion. The Internet is a collection of interconnected computer networks, linked by copper wires, fiber-optic cables and wireless connections. The Internet is fast becoming a basic feature of global civilization, so that what has traditionally been called ""civil society"" is now becoming identical with information technology society. Making the Internet widely used is everyone responsibility from governments and companies to individuals. In order to ensure widespread use of Internet we need at least three major milestones to be done: making it cheap, available and getting people ready for it.
 Making the Internet cheap is the governments' responsibilities, so everyone can afford it. Actually it is one of the recent challenges is to widespread the Internet among citizens. In order to achieve this the governments have to build a new solid infrastructure to support new technologies, push the involved companies to lower the prices and encourage businesses to convert to E-businesses by offering the services over the Internet for ease of accessibility, plus other advantages like saving time and money and bringing society up to date by eliminating the digital divide. Having said that, cheapness does not mean bad quality by any means! High speed Internet is essential and it is as important as exciting the Internet itself, since some recent statistics talk about Internet congestion within two years with the current infrastructure.
 Accessing the Internet anytime, anywhere and for anyone is what is called availability. Being able to access the Internet anytime means you can access it 24 hours 7 days a week, while supporting the Internet from anywhere means to allow people to access it at last mile in addition to access it through different mediums, such as dialup, DSL, cable TV and even by new wireless technology like WiFi or WiMax and anyone can access the Internet without any limitations. Availability is a big issue in many countries, since some of their infrastructures are not ready yet and may need to start digging all over the cities. Availability, in other words, means diversity and redundancy, so that in case of failure of one link the other will be ready immediately. 
 For the Internet to get widely used being cheap and available are not enough though. People need to be familiar with it, most Internet users tend to be young people, but still all people must be involved in this matter. Some governments have started public programs and awareness campaign to get citizens used to the Internet by offering free computer courses or cheap PCs with free Internet connection. Other countries started new initiatives by supporting the portals contents to attract people to use the Internet, offering all public services on the Internet either through their portals or by other companies. We can see today some tangible results of the Internet spreading everywhere so everyone finds his special world in the Internet.
 The Internet is an evolving technology in different areas and every day a new invention related to it is created. So, to keep up with the latest technology we must catch up with the technology in the market since it is growing faster than any thing else. The three milestones of cheapness, availability and readiness are continuing challenges in the world of the Internet, which puts more and more duties on governments companies and individuals.

The Internet is fast becoming a basic feature of global civilization, so that what has traditionally been called ""civil society"" is now becoming identical with information technology society. Making the Internet widely used is everyone responsibility from governments and companies to individuals. In order to ensure widespread use of Internet we need at least three major milestones to be done: making it cheap, available and getting people ready for it. Making the Internet cheap is the governments' responsibilities, so everyone can afford it. Actually it is one of the recent challenges is to widespread the Internet among citizens. In order to achieve this the governments have to build a new solid infrastructure to support new technologies, push the involved companies to lower the prices and encourage businesses to convert to E-businesses by offering the services over the Internet for ease of accessibility, plus other advantages like saving time and money and bringing society up to date by eliminating the digital divide. Having said that, cheapness does not mean bad quality by any means! High speed Internet is essential and it is as important as exciting the Internet itself, since some recent statistics talk about Internet congestion within two years with the current infrastructure. Accessing the Internet anytime, anywhere and for anyone is what is called availability. Being able to access the Internet anytime means you can access it 24 hours 7 days a week, while supporting the Internet from anywhere means to allow people to access it at last mile in addition to access it through different mediums, such as dialup, DSL, cable TV and even by new wireless technology like WiFi or WiMax and anyone can access the Internet without any limitations. Availability is a big issue in many countries, since some of their infrastructures are not ready yet and may need to start digging all over the cities. Availability, in other words, means diversity and redundancy, so that in case of failure of one link the other will be ready immediately. For the Internet to get widely used being cheap and available are not enough though. People need to be familiar with it, most Internet users tend to be young people, but still all people must be involved in this matter. Some governments have started public programs and awareness campaign to get citizens used to the Internet by offering free computer courses or cheap PCs with free Internet connection. Other countries started new initiatives by supporting the portals contents to attract people to use the Internet, offering all public services on the Internet either through their portals or by other companies. We can see today some tangible results of the Internet spreading everywhere so everyone finds his special world in the Internet. The Internet is an evolving technology in different areas and every day a new invention related to it is created. So, to keep up with the latest technology we must catch up with the technology in the market since it is growing faster than any thing else.

 What do you think is the most valuable invention since the past few centuries? Rosalie E. Leposky stated that a wave of electrical inventions dramatically changed the world as the 20th century progressed. In fact, since Thomas Edison found out how to produce electricity, the human amazingly has improved their cultures and quality of life a lot. Today, people depend entirely upon electricity for most of their lives. Three of the most important effects of electricity upon human life are increasing riches, making life more convenient, and improving human health.

 First of all, humans became rich by using electricity. People began to use electric light bulbs soon after the use of electricity, and using electricity helped them use night time, which they couldn't help using only for sleeping before. People could work far more than in the past with this, and finally they could own more riches than in the past. The invention of electricity also promoted the Industrial Revolution, which made machines produce a great number of materials at the same time. This caused a rise of average income. As a result, most people today don't need to worry about their food, clothing, and shelter. They just think about how to become richer.

 Second, electricity made life for humans more convenient. People pursued the study of electricity and finally found out how to produce electric energy. Since then, they have been able to enjoy convenience. For example, they devised the electric heater and air conditioner so that they could live comfortably all through the seasons. People also didn't have to work as hard as in the past, because electric machines work instead of them. In the case of traffic, many kinds of vehicles were invented such as the automobile, motorcycle, train, ship, and airplane. In the communicational aspect, all sorts of machines of communication, including the telephone were invented. Furthermore, improvement of the study of electricity led to the Informational Revolution. All of these things made the world smaller, got people in the world closer each other, and made it so that anyone can have all the information whenever the person wants.

 Finally, electricity has made people get healthier and healthier. The invention of electricity has improved various areas of science, especially the medical sciences. The machine which effected the development of the medical science was a computer. The computer was naturally used in daily life, but it was used to develop practical science. The development of medical science produced many kinds of useful machines such as MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging), CT(Computer Tomography), and they have contributed to save numbers of lives. Added to this, the development of medical science from the invention of electricity has lengthened the average life span of humans.

 In conclusion, electricity has influenced human society in rich, convenient, and healthy aspects since it was invented. Because electricity is used in almost all parts of human life, most societies must be functionally disordered without it. In addition, the importance of electricity as a replaceable energy is getting bigger and bigger as resources in the earth are drained. Sustaining the development of electric technology will continue to make human societies more affluent just as it has done in the past.","What do you think is the most valuable invention since the past few centuries?

Which, nature and nurture, contributes most to the intelligence of human beings? The nature and nurture debate has been a never-ending issue for writers and educators. Regarding this issue, we can find historical examples. In the sixteenth century, philosophers were divided into two groups, the empirical school (Nurture), represented by Locke, Hume and Mill, and the continental naturists (Nature), like Hobbes, Rousseau and Kant. From the whole twentieth century until now, it has been popular that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from nature. However, recently, adoption and twin studies performed by behavioral geneticists show that nurture does not effectively explain the variance for most traits of humans. Admittedly, some prodigies help people to consider the possibility of generic effects. Nevertheless, is it claimed that the intelligence of human beings is completely decided by their natural genes? If these prodigies had no education or no learning, could they keep their talent or intelligence? On the contrary, if they are trained and educated, can all people be geniuses? Considering these debates and studies, we could believe that both nurture and nature play an important role in our intelligent development. 
First, education could be considered as the factor of intelligence. As English empirical educationist and philosopher, John Locke postulated that the human mind was a blank slate, known as tabula rasa, education or learning could be a factor influencing the formation of intelligence. Additionally, according to the research performed by the University of Zurich (2003), the Korean has the highest IQ in the world. When we consider the result of this research, and the highest rate of literacy and the higher education fever of Korea, we can draw the possibility of the correlationship between IQ and education. More specifically, the educational fact can be divided into two parts: the contents of education and the moment of education. Regarding these two options, we can think about the intellectual ability of elementary school students being different from that of university students. This intellectual difference probably results from the different educational curriculum, which is designed to provide appropriate information according to the social development of human beings. According to Erik H. Erikson, Jewish German developmental psychologist and psychoanalyst, the environment in which a child lived was crucial to providing growth, adjustment, a source of self awareness and identity. Therefore, it could be alleged that the intelligence of humans is changeable, and intelligence is shaped by the conditions of nurture, like the contents of education and the moment of education.
Second, it might be suggested that nature is the other factor of intelligence. Although the traditional idea and many theories have added weight to the importance of nurture, some recent research provides meaningful evidence presenting the importance of nature. In order to remove the ambiguousness between nurture and nature, behavioral geneticists performed the adoption and twin studies. These studies indicated that family environmental factors may influence childhood IQ, accounting for up to a quarter of the variance and by late adolescence this correlation disappears. Also, these studies indicated adoptive siblings have no more similarity in IQ than strangers. As another evidence for the impact of nature, the argument of Judith Harris may be mentioned. According to her Pulitzer Prize-nominated book, The Nurture Assumption, nurture does not effectively explain the variance for most traits in the general population of the United States. These studies and theories illustrate the restrictive effects of nurture and thus emphasize the expanded role of nature, in human intelligence. Consequently, it can be said that the intelligence of humans is under generic features and thereby nature contributes to shaping the intelligence of humans. 
In conclusion, based on these datum mentioned above, we can say that both nurture and nature contribute to humans' intelligence and these two factors are not independent each other. Therefore, as the answer to the question, ""which, nature or nurture, is more influential to humans' intelligence?"" we can refer to Donald Hebb, a famous psychologist, who said ""which contributes more to the area of a rectangle, its length or its width?""

Y,C1153,16648,cx0,Chinese,Female,349,5,w,2335,1,989,977,977,"When you want to go to another city what is the first thing that comes to you mind? It must be 'I need to get a plane ticket'. You cannot imagine a life without plane. A businessman may say 'I spend most of my time on planes'. In old time people use trains, boats or horses while in modern society we can't survive without planes. What planes bring us were convenience, global business and safety.
Since plane were invented people can go to almost anywhere in a very short time. It is unbelievable convenient. Before there were planes people spent months to cross ocean by steamer. We all know how danger the ocean is and how helpless people will be when they are trapped in a storm. Even they finally crossed the ocean they may get lost already. Imagining the first people that found the American I have to say they are so lucky that after months or years on the sea they found what they needed successfully. Unfortunately not everyone had that luck. I believe travelling across the sea to see a new world was an impossible thing to most people in old time. However even using train to travel in land is not that optimistic. In order to use trains to travel around people need to spend a lot of money, time and labors to build railroads first. If there is a place that has many mountains the job will be incredible hard. After the railroads were built they still need regular maintain and that will be another big expense. Another trouble with train is that most people cannot tolerant the boring on a train especially in a long trip. However things changed after we had planes. When I came to the U.S. from China it only took 16 hours by plane. I know it is a little bit long but I almost crossed half of the earth which took months in the past. You may say we need to build airports to make the whole thing work but don't forget we have helicopters which are widely used in some place that do not have big airport. For example they can land on the top of hospital which means they save time and patients' lives. You can tell the big difference between with and without planes.
Furthermore, the use of planes promotes the global business. In old time business was limited in small areas because it was hard for people to communicate from long distance. Also it was impossible to transport commodities that are easy to spoil like fruits and vegetables. In old time of China people used horses to transport silk and porcelain to other countries but definitely not America which was too far from China. They couldn't bring too much products because they needed to bring food or clothes where they need to travel a long time. That was the reason that the price of these silk and porcelain were much higher than jewelry at that time. I figure that it was not a good business for general people. In contrast, we have global business today and we can transport anything we want. A businessman in New York can plan to sign a contract in the next day in Japan and don't need to worry about he cannot go back to spend weekend with family. You can buy the freshest fruits from other countries almost in very supermarket. What is better is that the prices of the import commodities are more acceptable because we have planes. Otherwise the planes also support the travelling business. People have never travelled that much like today in the history. You can go anywhere you are interested in, for example Australian, Canada or Europe. You won't be unpleasant because of the tiredness caused by long travelling. The planes do make our lives comfortable.
Finally in contrary to most people's think the plane is the safest vehicle. You may hear a lot about the crashes on newsreport but the percentage of it is pretty low comparing to other kinds of vehicles. It is true that when people think about travelling by plane the first thing comes in to mind is the crash. However the reason of this is not because plane is unsafe but is almost no one can survive from a crash, so every crash is so impressive that there is no way to forget them. However do you how many people dead in car accidents every day? It is even the first reason of death in China. We also have a lot of train or boat accidents. The most famous one is the sinking of Titanic. Who can predict that this great boat sank on its first trip? Sea is more powerful and dangerous than sky. You may think there are as same bad weathers in the sky as on the sea, but planes fly in the stratosphere where there is no air moving so there is no bad weather or even a little wind. In addition there are many strict policies about flying. Staffs working in airport check every plane carefully every day and won't let them get off if there is serious weather. I am not saying there is no danger to take a plane but the possibility that you meet a crash is very small.
In sum, the plane has a lot advantages and makes our lives better although it use oil which is not good. Maybe one day we can find another better energy for it. However no one can deny that we need plane very day. It makes our life convenient, makes the global business easier and it is the safest choice if you want to travel. When the first plane came out it could only fly 10 minutes, but this 10 minutes do changed the history and totally set human free.

The most famous one is the sinking of Titanic. Who can predict that this great boat sank on its first trip? Sea is more powerful and dangerous than sky. You may think there are as same bad weathers in the sky as on the sea, but planes fly in the stratosphere where there is no air moving so there is no bad weather or even a little wind. In addition there are many strict policies about flying. Staffs working in airport check every plane carefully every day and won't let them get off if there is serious weather. I am not saying there is no danger to take a plane but the possibility that you meet a crash is very small. In sum, the plane has a lot advantages and makes our lives better although it use oil which is not good. Maybe one day we can find another better energy for it. However no one can deny that we need plane very day. It makes our life convenient, makes the global business easier and it is the safest choice if you want to travel. When the first plane came out it could only fly 10 minutes, but this 10 minutes do changed the history and totally set human free. ","When you want to go to another city what is the first thing that comes to you mind? It must be 'I need to get a plane ticket'. You cannot imagine a life without plane. A businessman may say 'I spend most of my time on planes'. In old time people use trains, boats or horses while in modern society we can't survive without planes. What planes bring us were convenience, global business and safety. Since plane were invented people can go to almost anywhere in a very short time. It is unbelievable convenient. Before there were planes people spent months to cross ocean by steamer. We all know how danger the ocean is and how helpless people will be when they are trapped in a storm. Even they finally crossed the ocean they may get lost already. Imagining the first people that found the American I have to say they are so lucky that after months or years on the sea they found what they needed successfully. Unfortunately not everyone had that luck. I believe travelling across the sea to see a new world was an impossible thing to most people in old time. However even using train to travel in land is not that optimistic. In order to use trains to travel around people need to spend a lot of money, time and labors to build railroads first. If there is a place that has many mountains the job will be incredible hard. After the railroads were built they still need regular maintain and that will be another big expense. Another trouble with train is that most people cannot tolerant the boring on a train especially in a long trip. However things changed after we had planes. When I came to the U.S. from China it only took 16 hours by plane. I know it is a little bit long but I almost crossed half of the earth which took months in the past. You may say we need to build airports to make the whole thing work but don't forget we have helicopters which are widely used in some place that do not have big airport. For example they can land on the top of hospital which means they save time and patients' lives. You can tell the big difference between with and without planes. Furthermore, the use of planes promotes the global business. In old time business was limited in small areas because it was hard for people to communicate from long distance. Also it was impossible to transport commodities that are easy to spoil like fruits and vegetables. In old time of China people used horses to transport silk and porcelain to other countries but definitely not America which was too far from China. They couldn't bring too much products because they needed to bring food or clothes where they need to travel a long time. That was the reason that the price of these silk and porcelain were much higher than jewelry at that time. I figure that it was not a good business for general people. In contrast, we have global business today and we can transport anything we want. A businessman in New York can plan to sign a contract in the next day in Japan and don't need to worry about he cannot go back to spend weekend with family. You can buy the freshest fruits from other countries almost in very supermarket. What is better is that the prices of the import commodities are more acceptable because we have planes. Otherwise the planes also support the travelling business. People have never travelled that much like today in the history. You can go anywhere you are interested in, for example Australian, Canada or Europe. You won't be unpleasant because of the tiredness caused by long travelling. The planes do make our lives comfortable. Finally in contrary to most people's think the plane is the safest vehicle. You may hear a lot about the crashes on newsreport but the percentage of it is pretty low comparing to other kinds of vehicles. It is true that when people think about travelling by plane the first thing comes in to mind is the crash. However the reason of this is not because plane is unsafe but is almost no one can survive from a crash, so every crash is so impressive that there is no way to forget them. However do you how many people dead in car accidents every day? It is even the first reason of death in China. We also have a lot of train or boat accidents. The most famous one is the sinking of Titanic. Who can predict that this great boat sank on its first trip? Sea is more powerful and dangerous than sky.

How would you manage a company if you were a CEO of a company? Some people might want to completely control their employees, but some people might give their employees freedom to achieve their assignments. ""Which organizational structure should choose"" is a big deal for a company and a organization. It depends on the management's attitude, the culture of the organization, the phenomenon of the industry, and even the influence of society. There are several kinds of organizational structures. The flat structure and the hierarchical structure are the two most common and popular structures at present. Nevertheless, these two structures are completely different types of management for companies. The notable differences between these two structures are the organizational system, the organizational communication and the flexibility of the organization.

First of all, the organizational system of a company with the flat structure is different from that of a company with the hierarchical structure. The organizational chart of the company with the hierarchical structure is presented as a pyramid. There are several classes between top management and subordinates. The supervisors are responsible to the management and control their subordinates' performances. This kind of class could help a company to be more systematic. Everyone under the hierarchical structure has the concept of the class, so they will follow the policy strictly. The relationship of the class can help the company with hierarchical structure become a firm and strong organization. On the other hand, there is no supervisory class in the organizations with the flat structure. That means the top management manages the subordinates directly without the supervisors. The organizational chart of the flat structure becomes much flatter than that of the hierarchical system Therefore, general speaking, the size of the organization with the hierarchical structure is bigger than that of the organization with the flat structure because there is no supervisory classes in the flat organization structure. Furthermore, the employees are empowered completely by the top management. Obviously, they do not have to follow the regulation of company strictly. Compared with the company with the hierarchical structure, the company with the flat structure could become loose. 

In addition, organizational communication is another significant difference between the flat structure and the hierarchical structure. As I mentioned before, supervisory class places between the top management and employees in the hierarchical structure. If employees want to express any ideas and suggestions or problems to the top management, they must transmit their ideas through their supervisors. It takes a lot of time to pass the information which makes the company inflexible. It is a serious problem if inflexibility happens in a company. The top management cannot know well the problems that the employees meet and the real situation that the company faces, so they will not make decisions to solve the problems immediately. For example, an employee thinks the output would increase if the process of production were changed a little. He talks to his supervisor, but his supervisor could not change the process casually, so the supervisor must ask to the top management. Transmitting information must take them some time which means that they waste time as well. Also, the supervisors could pass the wrong information to the top management because they might misunderstand their subordinates' ideas or problems. It would result in the difficulty in communication of the company and the misunderstanding between upper class and employees. However, employees can communicate with the top management directly, so they do not have to pass their opinions through the supervisors. It saves a lot of time which is able to make the company more flexible. The top management could make decisions to cope with the problems right away when they receive their subordinates' responses. As the previous example, if the employee could talk to the top management directly, the management allows him to change the process of the production soon which might improve the output and bring the company more profit. Besides, the subordinates can talk to the top management directly and they can communicate with each other in person. Talking face to face can avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. 

The last difference between the flat structure and the hierarchical structure is flexibility of the company. Under the hierarchic structure, subordinates should follow the supervisors' and top management's requirements even though the requirements are not applicable, reasonable or flexible. They may give their superiors advice, but their superiors might not accept their ideas, especially when their management is stubborn. This situation would lead the company to be inflexible. Conversely, the employees at the company with the flat structure are empowered completely by the top management. They do not have to follow the regulation of company strictly. All they have to do is to reach goals of their company. They could adjust their processes and make decisions by themselves as long as these changes are beneficial for them to achieve their goals. When they face problems, they could deal with the problems immediately. It can help the employees to do their jobs efficiently. Moreover, the flexible work environment can not only help employees to finish their jobs easily but also stimulate them to create more ideas. The more ideas employees have, the more innovative products produced. The more products produced, the more profit made. 

To summarize, the hierarchical structure and the flat structure are quite different in terms of the organizational system, the organizational communication and the flexibility of the organization. The companies with the hierarchical structure could have stronger systems than those with the flat structure. Besides, the hierarchical structure could not provide communication ways to the employees and the top management. However, the flat structure could offer a good communication because of its flat organizational structure. Finally, the hierarchical structure could not become flexible organizations due to its hierarchy. Conversely, the flat organizational structure can make companies more flexible to deal with any problems. Apparently, the type of management affects a company or organization greatly. Therefore, choosing the appropriate structure is very important for a company or an organization to become successful.

Do you know what the most powerful analytical technique is, that can be used in environmental, food testing, pharmaceutical applications, forensics, and clinical research? If you are not familiar with these fields, perhaps you don't know that. It is Mass Spectrometry (briefly and most often abbreviated as MS). Mass Spectrometry is an analytical technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles. It can be used to identify unknown compounds, to quantify known compounds, and to elucidate the structure and chemical properties of molecules. It can provide valuable information to a wide range of professionals: physicians, chemists and biologists, to name a few. It is most generally used to find the composition of a physical sample by generating a mass spectrum representing the masses of sample components. The mass spectrum is measured by mass spectrometers which in general consist of three basic parts: an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector system. There are several types of ion sources: Electrospray ionization (ESI) , Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ,Atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), Inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and more. The most often used two methods of sample ionization are ESI and APCI. The following will discuss about advantages and disadvantages of these two forms of sample ionization that are ESI and APCI.

To begin with discussing about advantages and disadvantages of ESI and APCI, the meaning of these two terms should be clearly stated. ESI is the abbreviation of electrospray ionization, which is a technique used in mass spectrometry to produce ions, especially useful in producing ions from macromolecules because it overcomes the propensity of those molecules to fragment when ionized. For ESI, a sample exists as ion in the liquid phase. In the meantime, APCI is the abbreviation of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, which is an ionization method that used in mass spectrometry, that is, a form of chemical ionization which takes place at atmospheric pressure. Sample is ionized in the gas phase. Both of them are called as ion source, which is an equipment used to ionize analyte molecules and free them from the solid or liquid phase.

In the first place, both of ESI and APCI have their own advantages, but they are different in some way, such as the range of analytes, thermal liability and volatility, fragment of molecular ion, and sensitivity. The advantages of ESI and APCI are discussed respectively as follows. ESI can be applicable to a wide range of analytes. Thermal liability and volatility usually is not a problem for ESI method. It will produce minimal fragmentation of molecular ion. High molecular weights can be analyzed (multiple charging). This method has high sensitivity. As responding to ESI, APCI has the different following advantages. Low polarity molecules can be ionized. It has a wide dynamic range (4-5 orders of magnitude). It has the characteristic of mass sensitive (flow rate ?dependent) detection dependency. Higher buffer concentration allowed in the APCI.

In the second place, both of ESI and APCI have their own disadvantages too, but they are also different in some way too, such as ionization suppression, sensitivity. The disadvantages of ESI and APCI are summarized as following respectively. ESI has the main disadvantages such as ionization suppression: competition for the ions to get out of the droplet. In addition, mobile phase composition can affect sensitivity. As responding to ESI, APCI has the different disadvantage. Analytes must be thermally stable (up to 130-150C). In addition, analytes must be volatile.

Electrospray ionization is the primary ion source used in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry because it is a liquid-gas interface capable of coupling liquid chomatography with mass spectrometry. While APCI is basically gas phase ionization, it is unlike ESI which is a liquid phase ionization process. 

To make a conclusion, both of ESI and APCI have advantages and disadvantages. ESI and APCI are the most often used two methods of sample ionization. How to choose the ion sources depends on what kind of molecules to analyze.

In his book, The Third Shock, American writer and futurist, Alvin Toffler argued three types of societies based on the concept of 'waves'. According to him, in the third society, our current post industrial society, most resources can be substituted by information and the gap between producers and consumers of information can be bridged by technology. Therefore, it is possible that we are living in an information-oriented society and Internet is the main technology of this society. If it is so, what has been changed since the invention of Internet? What differences are between before and after the Invention of Internet? The Internet has led information democracy in three points: the quantity and quality of information, the way of communication and the period of information monopoly. 
To begin with, the quantity and quality of information could be a major difference by the Internet. Only a decade ago, we had to go through several steps to obtain required information. First, we found similar sources to right information within our given knowledge fool. Second, we went to libraries or book stores and then read all gathered sources. Finally, we selected the nearest information within them. Accordingly, the quantity and quality of obtained information was limited by the amount of knowledge we already knew, by the number and condition of libraries or book stores we could reach, and by the amount of time allowed to us. On the other hand, with World Wide Web, we can retrieve information required through a worldwide digital network with a click. As the report of the United States Commerce, the merging digital market (1999), we accessed 2,700 newspapers and 3,600 magazines on the web, and when the largest traditional book store provided 150 thousands, ANON_URLPAGE 2.5million books with brief description of books and book reviews. Now, with the Internet, although we are not a well-informed or have fragmentary, elementary knowledge, we can collect most information related to required information within a few seconds. As long as we can access the Internet, we can reach publicly available worldwide information beyond time, location and the quantity and quality of our schema .
Next, the Internet converted communication style from the one-way to two-way. In a strict sense, communication happens in a relationship between the givers and the receivers of information and this communication process can be divided to three parts, production, distribution, and acceptance. Most information had been produced by only the elite as the leading group of a society like philosophers, scientists, or artists and then passed to the general public. As if the strict vertical social structure of the middle age was, information was distributed and well controlled under a top-down system. However, since the invention of the Internet, information has been created and shared by both the elite and the public. Although some information and knowledge still have been produced by the elite, these information and knowledge sometimes have been examined by the public. In addition, the public has suggested new idea or thought on the web like blogs, homepages or replies without the elite's permission in a bottom-up system. That is to say, the flow of information has been changed from the vertical one-way communication to the horizontal two-way communication. The coexistence of these top-down and bottom-up systems has helped that an average person openly expresses and spreads his or her own opinion as new information. Therefore, it can be say that the Internet contributes to democratizing the information democracy from the standpoint of communication style. 
Third, we should regard the shortened period of information monopoly as the element of information democracy. In the past, because information was provided and distributed by a privileged minority, information monopoly was possible and thus the period of the monopoly was also able to be controlled by the elite. However, with the emergence of the Internet, the concept of information was shifted from a matter of being possessed to a matter of being accessed. If the development of mass media and transportation changed the world to one day zone in aspects of information distribution, on the contrary, the Internet opened the era of one second zone. This speedy distribution of information is supported by a worldwide digital transmission system and a number of internet users' participation under the horizontal communication. For instance, if we access the Internet, we can know what is happening in other countries far away. Although information hiding, steganography is intentionally modified, it can be easier and faster broken by anonymous someone, hackers than the past. It is, so to speak, the information democracy in the period of information monopoly.
In conclusion, it can be said that the Internet has resulted in the information democracy in aspects of the quantity and quality, the way of communication and the period of monopoly. With the Internet, we can access to unlimited information, advocate new information more freely, and faster share information. Although the problem of digital divide is raised, this problem seems not to come from the invention of the Internet but to come from the wrong use of the Internet. However, in order to establish more integral information democracy, this imbalance resulting from the use of information should be solved. 
","In his book, The Third Shock, American writer and futurist, Alvin Toffler argued three types of societies based on the concept of 'waves'. According to him, in the third society, our current post industrial society, most resources can be substituted by information and the gap between producers and consumers of information can be bridged by technology. Therefore, it is possible that we are living in an information-oriented society and Internet is the main technology of this society. If it is so, what has been changed since the invention of Internet? What differences are between before and after the Invention of Internet? The Internet has led information democracy in three points: the quantity and quality of information, the way of communication and the period of information monopoly. To begin with, the quantity and quality of information could be a major difference by the Internet. Only a decade ago, we had to go through several steps to obtain required information.

What is the hardware you most frequently use when you listen to music? Though there have been many kinds of hardware such as MC(Mini Cassette) players, CD(Com-pact Disc) players, MD(Mini Discs), MP3(Medium Playing record) players since the LP(Long playing Record) was invented, the two things that most used extensively until now are CD players and MP3 players. That's because that people have become prefer to a small portable one as science and technology have been developed. Both the people who prefer CD players and MP3 players have their own reasons based on their advantages and disadvantages. In fact, using CD players and MP3 players to listen to music may look very similar to each other, however, they have several differences. Their differences basically are from the differences between a DAT file- a type of file in a CD- and an MP3 file. The main differences between them are price, the size of files, the quality of sound, and the possibility of reproduction.

First of all, there is a great difference between the price of a CD and MP3 files. The average price of a single CD is 3 times higher than the same numbers of music as MP3 files. That's because collecting music as a CD is considered more valuable than as MP3 files in general. Actually, there are many people over the world who enjoy music have been collecting music as CDs. They say that collecting CDs absolutely is far more meaningful, comparing with MP3 files, because a CD includes a musician's profile, lyrics of the music, more information about the music, and suchlike. In contrast, the price of an MP3 file is very cheap. Also, unlikely CDs, MP3 files are separated as a piece of music. For that reason, the people who prefer MP3 files can download the music which they only want. Most of them are not interested in collecting music, but enjoying many kinds of music. Because downloading MP3 files is far cheaper than purchasing a CD and available whenever they want, they can pick the music they only want to listen out of a package of music in a CD and delete them easily to replace the music by newest music.

Second, the size of a DAT file is very different from the size of an MP3 file.
The size of a DAT file generally is about 8 to 14 times bigger than the size of an MP3 file. Because of that, the maximum number of music in a CD is around 20. In other words, to listen to various kind of music, the CDs which include the music are needed. Hence the people who prefer to listen to music with CDs can not help listening to music inside where there the CDs are to enjoy various music, which are in different CDs. Otherwise, they have to carry all the CDs which include the music they would like to listen to when they are outside. It's very uncomfortable to carry CDs whenever they move from one place to another. On the contrary, the size of an MP3 file is very small. Because of the small size, MP3 files could be carried so easily. More than 200 files normally are kept in a pretty small MP3 player, which has a GB(Gigabyte=1024MB, or Megabit). As most MP3 players today have 2 to 50 GB, the people who prefer to listen to music with MP3 files are able to carry at least 400 to 20,000 pieces of music at a time. They can also keep a lot of pieces of music with just small space in the hardware of an MP3 player or a computer. For them, carrying and keeping music are quite simple.

 Third, a DAT file and a MP3 file have different qualities of sound from each other. The quality of sound of a DAT file is 1411Kbps(Kilobits per second), which is about 11 times higher than an MP3 file's. The reason that the quality of sound of a DAT file is high is that a DAT file is produced by being recorded the original playing sound as it is. That is, the quality of sound is almost same with the original sound, so the people who prefer to listen to music with CDs can enjoy the music which has the almost equal sound with the music which the musician played directly whenever they listen to music. On the other hand, the quality of sound of an MP3 file is created by being changed the original playing sound. All the People have AF(Audible Frequency), the range that a person can hear a sound, and they only are able to sense the sound within the range of AF when they listen to music. In fact, however, a piece of music has very wide frequency, which includes the range that people cannot sense at all. Since the sound of an MP3 file consists of only the range of AF, with deleting the other wide range, the file could be extremely small with high quality of sound. Actually, it is greatly hard for even experts in music or sound to distinguish the difference between the quality of sound of a DAT file and the quality of sound of an MP3 file. However, there is an obvious gap between the two kinds of files. In addition, some experts have pointed that MP3 files are so far from a natural sound so that listening to them gives people harmful influence.

The last difference between a DAT file and an MP3 file is the possibility of reproduction. Because a DAT file is very close to the original sound, it could be reproduced, or changed to other kinds of files including an MP3 file, as many times as you want without losing the quality of sound. However, the size of the file that is from a CD has to be bigger than an MP3 file to maintain the original quality of sound. Also, the CD always is needed to reproduce other files. In contrast, it is hard to reproduce an MP3 file because of the low quality of sound. If you reproduce an MP3 file, you will be able to recognize that the quality of sound is decreased as it is reproduced. An MP3 file could freely be moved between many kinds of hardware or devices and exchanged between people, instead. The easiness of shift is the strongest advantage of an MP3 file.

In conclusion, there are certain several differences between a DAT file and an MP3 file. They both have each advantages and disadvatages, so you can choose one of them which best answers on your purpose. Though CD players and MP3 players, which have both their own merits and demerits, lead now the world music market, more superior and ultramodern hardware and files will be produced from now on. In the future, there might be an innovative file which has low price, extremely small size, very high quality of sound, and is reproducible as many as you want.","What is the hardware you most frequently use when you listen to music?

 One day, cars look like having a race in the morning on the middle of downtown, Seoul. Many cars are running very fast, sounding the horn. It looks like that someone would give a prize if the cars drive the fastest on the road. The people never yield and even smile. The police officers and the drivers on the street are so busy, they are not themselves.
Before I came to Pittsburgh, I used to drive my car and take a bus in Korea. Then, arriving to Pittsburgh, though I had taken a bus before I got a driver license, I got a Pennsylvania driver license and became be able to drive here as well. Therefore, I've experienced both area; Pittsburgh and Seoul. There is no analogy between two cities but some differences: transportations, the style of drive and some emerging social problems.
 Wherever people live, they should take a bus or subway, before they come to be able to drive a car. In Korea, many usually take a bus or subway. It is not only fast but economical. Although Seoul is several times as larger than Pittsburgh, the subway takes people everywhere they want to in Seoul. For Bus, there is the road only for buses on center of the road. Whereas most private cars get stuck in the much traffic, buses can run much faster than the cars. Moreover, if people want to take one of them, most transportations run every less than 10minutes. On the contrary, Pittsburgh is a little bit different from Seoul. There are the subway lines just in some area not everywhere in Pittsburgh. It is said that only a third of Pittsburgh areas have a subway lines. Also, few buses run in Pittsburgh except the area of downtown and Oakland. Most people who drive a car in the morning have many complains about that and rather choose to drive. The cost of the transportations is also not that low, so if they are not Pitt student or someone who is able to use them for free, they should spend lots of money on the transportation.
 Second, the style of driving in two cities is totally different. Seoul, the capital city of Korea, is very busy and traffic is also too busy. However, the drivers drive so fast and roughly. It is said that Seoul is more crowded than New York. In downtown Seoul, the sound of horn is endless, so it is even not really easy to stay outside long time. People in Seoul (big city) tend to be rash and in hurry. Because every driver drives too fast and rough, slow drivers cannot drive in Seoul and they drive with reluctance. Police officers sometimes block streets to catch people who drunk. Given the control, many people try not to drink before they drive. However, many people still die by DUI or car accident. The death related car constitutes majority of death in Korea. Korean government must think up an innovative regulation for the death by car. On the contrary, however, most drivers in Pittsburgh are so calm and gentle that people rarely sound horn unless they are in big danger. Also they are willing to yield each other and that impress some foreigners like Koreans. If a person sounds horn loudly, the person must feel guilty of that. Many Asians are surprised to drive and cannot get used to the gentle drivers. Even people who were not able to drive in Korea because it is too busy are able to drive very well in Pittsburgh. On the other hand, people who used to drive just in Pittsburgh are not able to drive in Seoul or have an accident because it is not easy to drive any more.
 Third, there are many different social problems between two cities. Two big problems in Korea are Parking spaces and the expensive gas. One fifth of whole Koreans live in Seoul which is the capital of Korea and most family has at least one car. Parking fee is so expensive and even people struggle against their neighbors for parking space. It is funny that they fight each other for parking space but it's a big problem in Seoul. Some neighbors even use their public park as parking space. Seoul citizen have to give up their precious place for car parking. Also, the gas which is another problem in Korea is so expensive. The cost of the gas in Korea is twice as expensive as that of the gas in the USA. That's why Korean people say ""Gas is Gold in Korea."" For car, Korean government should fix infrastructure of these problems. However, it is good that Pittsburgh doesn't have to worry about these problems thanks to the US government and big area of nation.
 In conclusion, there are several differences between traffic in Seoul and in Pittsburgh. For transportation, Seoul is better than Pittsburgh because Seoul is a huge city and people like a speed. However, for other things, namely, the style of drive and some emerging social problems, Pittsburgh is much better than Seoul. So, Korean should learn about gentle driving etiquette from Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh should learn about good system of transportation from Seoul. If so, both must become great city about traffic.
","One day, cars look like having a race in the morning on the middle of downtown, Seoul. Many cars are running very fast, sounding the horn. It looks like that someone would give a prize if the cars drive the fastest on the road. The people never yield and even smile. The police officers and the drivers on the street are so busy, they are not themselves. Before I came to Pittsburgh, I used to drive my car and take a bus in Korea. Then, arriving to Pittsburgh, though I had taken a bus before I got a driver license, I got a Pennsylvania driver license and became be able to drive here as well. Therefore, I've experienced both area; Pittsburgh and Seoul. There is no analogy between two cities but some differences: transportations, the style of drive and some emerging social problems. Wherever people live, they should take a bus or subway, before they come to be able to drive a car. In Korea, many usually take a bus or subway. It is not only fast but economical. Although Seoul is several times as larger than Pittsburgh, the subway takes people everywhere they want to in Seoul. For Bus, there is the road only for buses on center of the road. Whereas most private cars get stuck in the much traffic, buses can run much faster than the cars. Moreover, if people want to take one of them, most transportations run every less than 10minutes. On the contrary, Pittsburgh is a little bit different from Seoul. There are the subway lines just in some area not everywhere in Pittsburgh. It is said that only a third of Pittsburgh areas have a subway lines. Also, few buses run in Pittsburgh except the area of downtown and Oakland. Most people who drive a car in the morning have many complains about that and rather choose to drive. The cost of the transportations is also not that low, so if they are not Pitt student or someone who is able to use them for free, they should spend lots of money on the transportation.

 ""Inventions That Changed The World"" is a BBC production I have been following for a while, every episode they present a new invention such as guns, computers, etc. One of the best episodes I have seen in the show was the episode talked about airplane and how this invention has changed the world. Before inventing the airplane people were traveling using different ways such as trains, cars, ships, horses, camels or even on feet which made traveling really tough thing to do for many reasons. After inventing the cars and trains traveling had improved a lot in different aspects, but once the airplane invented, the whole people life has changed not only traveling and that appeared in different aspects: time, speed, distance, cost and convenience as we will be discussing each of them in this essay. 
 In the past before airplane era people spend days and may be months in traveling from place to place take for example if you wanted to travel from Pittsburgh to Washington DC this would take around eight to nine days walking assuming that the road is flat any convenient and you walk ten hours a day. If you travel by horses then you will short the time to one or two days and by car it is even better since it would last for four to five hours depends on the speed. In the other side when it comes to airplane it is something completely different, within the same distance this would last for one hour or even shorter. Time saving by traveling through airplane would be extremely valuable when it comes to overseas traveling, for example the time you will spend to travel by ship to Japan might be one month could be done by airplane within hours! Interestingly, even the long flight might different from one to another according to what is called tail wind, which is if you fly against the wind would take longer time than if you are in the same wind's direction, so the pilot has to adjust the high level according to the same direction for time and fuel reasons. What has mentioned has led people to travel more often and made people travel different flight in on day which could not be done in the past except in months. 
 Talking about the time in traveling would lead to talk about speed since it is related somehow. We are now in the speed age and every thing goes fast not mention the travel which is the most important thing to be fast. Speed is various as in time, the slowest way is traveling on feet and humans average is three miles per hour while on horses it goes up to fifty miles per hour and on cars it can go up to one hundred fifty miles per hour. In airplane the speed also is something way different, in the commercial airplane the average speed is five hundreds miles per hour and it can get up to 1000 mile per hour in the advanced jet engines. 
 Talking about time and speed will lead also to talk about distance. Traveling on feet or by any ground transportations are constrained and limited in terms of the distance you can cross, for example valleys, mountains, rivers, seas, oceans ,etc the obstacles you encounter when you travel on ground are not there if you travel in the sky. Moreover those obstacles not only will limit you or delay you it also will make the distance far way since you need most of the time to go around in order to avoid them. Some other problems you may face in ground travel are not existed in the fly like detoured roads or work roads. Although the airlines are not all directed from point to point to avoid airplanes accident it is though straighter than ground roads since there are nothing in the air to avoid. 
 Being a cost-effective in travel is an important issue; in the old days if you want to travel from place to place you need to take everything with you, which make it hard to travel alone since you can not carry every thing with you, so you may travel with caravan. Traveling in cars or by trains has it is cost as well despite it is not the same cost in traveling with caravan, but still it has its cost especially one the long ways, though it is vary from case to case. In airplane travel the cost is various too and it sometimes cost from one hundred up to $ 10,000 depends on the distance, class, season, number of luggage and many other factors. But the cost now is competitive with the new economical airlines companies that offer the less service with best affordable prices. 
 All the differences we talked about: time, speed, distance and cost results in the convenience. How convenient the travel in airplane is? If you know that you could travel from east cost to the west cost within the same day and finish your job and return back in the same day and the only thing you need is a slip written on it the flight number and the seat number called ""ticket"" you will no this is could not be easies what so ever. And before inventing the airplane if you told someone about this story he will believe you are an idiot but it is real now!

Did you visit the Heinz History Center this winter? If you happened to be there in the last December, you couldn't forget the Darkest Month exhibit----an exhibition and symposium commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Monongah and Darr Coal Mining Disasters. On the morning of December 6, 1907, hundreds of coal miners entered the coal mine at Monongah, West Virginia, 361 of them never came out. Thirteen days later, on December 19, a violent explosion at the Darr Mine in western Pennsylvania claimed the lives of 239 additional coal miners. Those who died in December of 1907 were victims of two of the worst mining calamities in American history. The month in which they were killed was the deadliest in the history of American coal mining. How could these accidents happen? Hence an important issue that people want to find out what and how cause these coal mining disasters is the accident analysis.
Accident is the unplanned event. It usually has the result of the failure of people, equipment, materials, or environment to react as expected. Accident analysis can help people to determine the sequences of events leading to failure, to identify the cause of the accident, and to find methods to prevent accident from recurring. Accidents can cause different consequences, such as production stop, equipment damage, wounded or even death of worker. In short, the consequences of accidents include personal injury and property loss. The most important thing is to identify the cause of accident.
Many reasons can lead accidents, such as natural factors, environmental factors, personal factors, poor management safety policy and decisions. The natural factors, for instance, include mine floods of the underground water, explosions and fires by methane gas in the coal layer and poor roof falling for coal mining. The human factors include over confident, ignoring safety procedures, mental distraction from work, poor maintenance, and improper use of equipment, poor management safety policy and decisions. All these causes can be referred to two categories?natural factor and human error. 

Let us consider the natural factors for the accident in coal mine. As we know, coal mining is inherently dangerous. Miners are exposed to hazards well in excess of those working in other occupations. Accidents may occur from fall of roof materials, excessive heat and humidity, poor lighting, fires, floods, elevator failures, use of unsafe equipment, and haulage. Those kinds of accidents may kill or maim one or two workers at a time. More dangerous hazards are explosions caused by high concentrations of airborne dust or methane gas, which could kill dozens or even hundreds of miners at once. 
Coal mine is largely dependent on the geological conditions. Both regional geological conditions and local geological conditions can influence the safety of coal mine. Some coal seams are far underground, miners in such regions must tunnel far underground to reach them, and the risk of explosion due to methane gas is high. A gas explosion at Fuxin, northeast China killed 203 people in 2005. The accident happened 242 meters (794 feet) below the ground. Rescuing is difficult after this kind of blast. An explosion at the Sago Mine, West Virginia, killed 12 people in January, 2006. There are so many accidents happened in the major coal production countries.

On the other hand, let us consider the human error for accident in coal mine. In most accidents people tend to look for things to blame, because it's easier than digging for root causes. Consider an important statistic: 80 out of every 100 accidents are the fault of the person involved in the incident. Unsafe Acts cause four times as many accidents & injuries as unsafe conditions. The human errors include being over confident, ignoring safety procedures, mental distraction from work, poor maintenance, and improper use of equipment, and poor management safety policy and decisions.
Being over confident can lead to an accident. Being confident is good, but over confident is too good. This psychological activity can lead to improper procedures, tools or methods in work. In coal mine especially the deep underground mine, people action is slow than normal condition, therefore it is one of causes of accident in coal mine.
Ignoring safety procedures is the common cause in many accidents. The safety procedures are made to insure working safety. Understanding how the safety procedures are made will help you to observe them. The most safety procedures in coal mines are made on the base of the results of many accidents analysis and safety research. Failing to observe these procedures can endanger you.
Poor management safety policy and decisions are the management causes of coal mine. If the policy and decisions are made poor, they will bad influence to the safety issue. Some accidents seems as natural causes to accident, but in fact it is caused by human error. For example, In May of 1980, a mine located in the Val d'Or region of the province of Quebec in Canada, which was operated by Belmoral Mines Ltd experienced a failed crown pillar, resulting in the death of eight miners and putting sixteen others in harms way. The crown pillar separating the 1-7 level from overlying overburden ultimately failed, permitting an estimated 1.5 million cubic feet of liquefied sediment to gain entry into the mine. According to the study of Douglas E Sweeney and Malcolm Scoble (2007, ANON_URLPAGE.), the accident was due to human error, which includes that workers were not competent to work in such a high risk setting, workers did not have the requisite knowledge of hazard assessment, safety or emergency response. The mine supervision lacked an understanding of their roles, responsibilities and geo-mechanical acumen, and mine management was suffering from cognitive dissonance, and also there were decision errors.
Improving the mine rescue system, overall government enforcement and inspection system, mine conditions through elimination of safety hazards will help to prevent accident. 

Although natural factor can cause many coal mining accident, human error is the key cause of coal mining accident. Sticking to safety procedures and avoiding human errors should be always in mind. The most important is to prevent accident from recurring. Mark Twain once said ""It is better to be careful 100 times than to get killed once.""

The human errors include being over confident, ignoring safety procedures, mental distraction from work, poor maintenance, and improper use of equipment, and poor management safety policy and decisions. Being over confident can lead to an accident. Being confident is good, but over confident is too good. This psychological activity can lead to improper procedures, tools or methods in work. In coal mine especially the deep underground mine, people action is slow than normal condition, therefore it is one of causes of accident in coal mine. Ignoring safety procedures is the common cause in many accidents. The safety procedures are made to insure working safety. Understanding how the safety procedures are made will help you to observe them. The most safety procedures in coal mines are made on the base of the results of many accidents analysis and safety research. Failing to observe these procedures can endanger you. Poor management safety policy and decisions are the management causes of coal mine. If the policy and decisions are made poor, they will bad influence to the safety issue. Some accidents seems as natural causes to accident, but in fact it is caused by human error. For example, In May of 1980, a mine located in the Val d'Or region of the province of Quebec in Canada, which was operated by Belmoral Mines Ltd experienced a failed crown pillar, resulting in the death of eight miners and putting sixteen others in harms way. The crown pillar separating the 1-7 level from overlying overburden ultimately failed, permitting an estimated 1.5 million cubic feet of liquefied sediment to gain entry into the mine. According to the study of Douglas E Sweeney and Malcolm Scoble (2007, ANON_URLPAGE.), the accident was due to human error, which includes that workers were not competent to work in such a high risk setting, workers did not have the requisite knowledge of hazard assessment, safety or emergency response. The mine supervision lacked an understanding of their roles, responsibilities and geo-mechanical acumen, and mine management was suffering from cognitive dissonance, and also there were decision errors. Improving the mine rescue system, overall government enforcement and inspection system, mine conditions through elimination of safety hazards will help to prevent accident. Although natural factor can cause many coal mining accident, human error is the key cause of coal mining accident. Sticking to safety procedures and avoiding human errors should be always in mind. The most important is to prevent accident from recurring. Mark Twain once said ""It is better to be careful 100 times than to get killed once.""","Did you visit the Heinz History Center this winter? If you happened to be there in the last December, you couldn't forget the Darkest Month exhibit----an exhibition and symposium commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Monongah and Darr Coal Mining Disasters. On the morning of December 6, 1907, hundreds of coal miners entered the coal mine at Monongah, West Virginia, 361 of them never came out. Thirteen days later, on December 19, a violent explosion at the Darr Mine in western Pennsylvania claimed the lives of 239 additional coal miners. Those who died in December of 1907 were victims of two of the worst mining calamities in American history. The month in which they were killed was the deadliest in the history of American coal mining. How could these accidents happen? Hence an important issue that people want to find out what and how cause these coal mining disasters is the accident analysis. Accident is the unplanned event. It usually has the result of the failure of people, equipment, materials, or environment to react as expected. Accident analysis can help people to determine the sequences of events leading to failure, to identify the cause of the accident, and to find methods to prevent accident from recurring. Accidents can cause different consequences, such as production stop, equipment damage, wounded or even death of worker. In short, the consequences of accidents include personal injury and property loss. The most important thing is to identify the cause of accident. Many reasons can lead accidents, such as natural factors, environmental factors, personal factors, poor management safety policy and decisions. The natural factors, for instance, include mine floods of the underground water, explosions and fires by methane gas in the coal layer and poor roof falling for coal mining. The human factors include over confident, ignoring safety procedures, mental distraction from work, poor maintenance, and improper use of equipment, poor management safety policy and decisions. All these causes can be referred to two categories?natural factor and human error. Let us consider the natural factors for the accident in coal mine. As we know, coal mining is inherently dangerous. Miners are exposed to hazards well in excess of those working in other occupations. Accidents may occur from fall of roof materials, excessive heat and humidity, poor lighting, fires, floods, elevator failures, use of unsafe equipment, and haulage. Those kinds of accidents may kill or maim one or two workers at a time. More dangerous hazards are explosions caused by high concentrations of airborne dust or methane gas, which could kill dozens or even hundreds of miners at once. Coal mine is largely dependent on the geological conditions. Both regional geological conditions and local geological conditions can influence the safety of coal mine. Some coal seams are far underground, miners in such regions must tunnel far underground to reach them, and the risk of explosion due to methane gas is high. A gas explosion at Fuxin, northeast China killed 203 people in 2005. The accident happened 242 meters (794 feet) below the ground. Rescuing is difficult after this kind of blast. An explosion at the Sago Mine, West Virginia, killed 12 people in January, 2006. There are so many accidents happened in the major coal production countries. On the other hand, let us consider the human error for accident in coal mine. In most accidents people tend to look for things to blame, because it's easier than digging for root causes. Consider an important statistic: 80 out of every 100 accidents are the fault of the person involved in the incident. Unsafe Acts cause four times as many accidents & injuries as unsafe conditions. The human errors include being over confident, ignoring safety procedures, mental distraction from work, poor maintenance, and improper use of equipment, and poor management safety policy and decisions.

 People get married for their happiness. Truly, a marriage makes people happy and has them have a great family. However, If once people get divorced, the situation changes. A family gets hurt seriously by a divorce. In 1970's a divorce boomed that the rate doubled in the U.S. Divorce is serious problem not only in the U.S but in other nations including S. Korea.
 Parents choose divorce for their better life and many of divorced people live better life after that. However, for children it is exact disaster to see that their parents get divorced. The children in divorced families have several severe problems on them namely, emotional problems, early sexual experimenting, dropping out of school, delinquency, teen pregnancy, and drug use and so on. If so, why do many people get divorced even though it hurts their children seriously? There are diverse reasons for divorce: lack of love and trust, financial problem, differences between a couple and social change.

 First, even though people get married each other, they usually lack love and trust. It is absolutely true that these two things are crucial for a healthy family. There is a program on Television entitled 'Cheetahs'. In this TV program, spouses ask staffs to expose their spouse's liaison. While this program is real and very exciting, it is very sad as well. The spouses don't have any trust and love, so one of them asks the program to make another one feel ashamed. Also, one goes out with another woman or man, not one's spouse because the person doesn't love his spouse any more. As the program shows us, most people get divorced because they do not trust and love each other anymore. Therefore, for most divorced couples, lack of love and trust is one of the most important to get divorced.
 Second, another reason for divorce is a financial problem. Money is necessary to keep a family healthy. Though money is not everything in life, it is said to be an integral part of life. There is a sentence ""Marriage is not a romance but real."" A married couple had spent great time until a disaster that the husband got fired came to the family all of sudden. Due to the incident, the wife started complaining and being disappointed with her husband, so they struggled much more often than before. They still loved each other but the life became hard and the relationship between them is not like before. Seriously, many couples get divorced due to the economic problem. These days, in fact, many women care about not only men's ability but also their wealth before getting married. There are some companies which introduce people who want to marry. Before people sign up the company, they should give all their information of them. The companies expect them to give them information which is their looking, education, background, job, annual salary. Good annual salary means a popular person among the people. In short, wealth became very important part of marriage.
 Third, people get divorced out of a difference of personality which is selfish. Even though couples have known each other before getting married, it is not really enough to know each other perfectly. People can notice spouse's every aspect including great ones and awful ones. Also, it is so natural that they might have totally different personality because they have not lived together for decades. Unless they make a concession or understand spouse, it must make some troubles between them of course. For instance, a couple years ago, one married couple got divorced. The reason why they got divorced was that they have a different style of using restroom. Whereas the wife prefers to close the cap of toothpaste, the husband prefers to leave open the cap of toothpaste after brushing teeth. It is impossible reason for divorce, however, they did just because they could not understand each other and stand each other's differences. Not even only for this, married couple cannot help seeing spouse' real character by living together. For this reason, old people tend to say that people should know so deeply about their spouse to-be before getting married.
 Last, a change of society has caused divorce. As time passes, people like to claim themselves and be selfish. Especially, for women, since 19Century, a lot of social movements for women's right have emerged. The crusaders think that individual happiness is far more important than any other things such as family and children. Many women have chosen divorce for individual happiness than their family and children with the movements. To ask individual's happiness too much leads a family to bad of course. For instance, it was natural that if the oldest son gets married, he usually takes care of his parents by living together. However, if the wife had disagreed against the fact with selfishness, the family must have had some troubles among them. Like this, the change that people comes to claim only their rights and be more selfish causes divorce as well.

 In conclusion, there are many reasons for divorce which are pretty reasonable or not. Whatever the reason is, however, people should remind this. Once people marry, the person is not only the one but the member of a family who must be responsible for the family. As people already know, divorce has a terrible effect on the children's life. If so, the people cannot decide to get divorced easily for the sake of the lovely children, or they might think at least one more. Did you love your husband? Do you love your child?

According to Internet World Stats, as of December 30, 2007, Internet is used by 1.319 billion people. The Internet making World Wide Web possible is being evolved to Web 2.0 . This Web 2.0 sounding like a new version of some old technology means a new Internet environment, which allows more interaction between information on the World Wide Web and its common users. Now, the common internet users' role and position are being changed from a receiver and user of information to a provider and creator of information. Yet, these common users' changed position does not mean a change of their knowledge or increase of their knowledge to modify and add information. Consequently, the new environment of Web 2.0 requires software and web developers to provide and build more effective devices to facilitate end-users' participation and to reinforce usability for them. Web usability could be raised and supported by good information design; good graphic design, good interface design and good interaction design. 
In the era of Web 2.0, the effect of graphic design seems still valid. Graphic design can build the impression of a web page and this impression constructed by visual elements of the web page contributes to delivering information efficiently. Like other forms of design, graphic design refers to both designing that is a process to create communication visually with using text and images, and designs or product generated by the process. In order to present information, graphic design uses design elements and principles . These elements form the basic vocabulary of visual design, while the principles constitute the broader structural aspects of the visual composition. By the combination of these design elements and principles, diverse compositions can be created. These visual compositions affect users' perception and the perceived 'look and feel' establishes users' cognition. Although Web 2.0 provides more dynamic environment, the users of Web 2.0 are not different from the ones from Web 1.0. As a result, the traditional graphic design can still serve raising usability because this graphic design has been based on the visual effects of the design elements and principles.
Next, interface design contributes to usability by assigning information properly and visual devices and reflecting practical essential information. The process of interface design is a process to transform the structure of information to the visual structure on a screen. In other words, interface design is providing frames to keep information and space to communicate between the information and users. Although, in this point, interface design can be confusing with graphic design, while graphic design just deals with colors and shapes, interface design includes treating a conceptual and abstract structure of information. Therefore, interface design can build a more accessible screen structure by arranging and organizing information structure. In addition, regarding the changing environment of Web 2.0, another possibility of interface design could be expected. Information is composed of three aspects; business aspects, technical aspects and aspects of users. In the environment of Web 2.0, the requirements of business aspects and technical aspects are dramatically being changed and these different requirements are requesting innovative interface design. Nevertheless, there are the same users as the ones from the era of Web 1.0. Accordingly, interface design can support usability by minimizing user's efforts to adapt to the new environment and utilizing experience and knowledge of users. 
Lastly, usability can be attributed to successful interaction by facilitating and drawing correct control of users. Interaction design focuses on users' behaviors which occur when users communicate with visual interface devices. Unlike the interface of printed matters, because the web interface accompanies users' control of visual devices, web usability values system's working and response to this users' behavior above everything else. Interaction design is often associated with the interface design in a variety of media but concentrates on defining and presenting users' behavior over time. Accordingly, interaction design focuses on developing the system to respond to the user's experience. As, with the Web 2.0, dynamic environment become common and information technology develops, interaction between systems and users becomes various and increases. Therefore, successful interaction design requests deep knowledge about new technology as well as understanding users. It means, by using high technology, building user friendly web environment. Therefore, technology-oriented interaction design might enhance users' understanding and control. 
In conclusion, the new web environment or Web 2.0 opens more chances for users to communicate with systems and at the same time needs changes in design patterns in order to actualize users' more successful and easier communication, that is, usability. This usability can be established by the design elements and principles-oriented graphic design, the interface design having a balance between new requirements of business and technology, and the interaction design resulting from deep understanding users and information technology. Considering all information design levels, the utmost usability probably seems to go toward digital warm, humane design. Then, next a decade later, what can we expect for usability? A Xerox PARC scientist, Alan Kay said ""the best way to predict the future is to invent it."" Between the advancing technology and the people who will use it stand designers and their duty is shaping and guiding the future into humane forms.

Although Web 2.0 provides more dynamic environment, the users of Web 2.0 are not different from the ones from Web 1.0. As a result, the traditional graphic design can still serve raising usability because this graphic design has been based on the visual effects of the design elements and principles. Next, interface design contributes to usability by assigning information properly and visual devices and reflecting practical essential information. The process of interface design is a process to transform the structure of information to the visual structure on a screen. In other words, interface design is providing frames to keep information and space to communicate between the information and users. Although, in this point, interface design can be confusing with graphic design, while graphic design just deals with colors and shapes, interface design includes treating a conceptual and abstract structure of information. Therefore, interface design can build a more accessible screen structure by arranging and organizing information structure. In addition, regarding the changing environment of Web 2.0, another possibility of interface design could be expected. Information is composed of three aspects; business aspects, technical aspects and aspects of users. In the environment of Web 2.0, the requirements of business aspects and technical aspects are dramatically being changed and these different requirements are requesting innovative interface design. Nevertheless, there are the same users as the ones from the era of Web 1.0. Accordingly, interface design can support usability by minimizing user's efforts to adapt to the new environment and utilizing experience and knowledge of users. Lastly, usability can be attributed to successful interaction by facilitating and drawing correct control of users. Interaction design focuses on users' behaviors which occur when users communicate with visual interface devices. Unlike the interface of printed matters, because the web interface accompanies users' control of visual devices, web usability values system's working and response to this users' behavior above everything else. Interaction design is often associated with the interface design in a variety of media but concentrates on defining and presenting users' behavior over time. Accordingly, interaction design focuses on developing the system to respond to the user's experience. As, with the Web 2.0, dynamic environment become common and information technology develops, interaction between systems and users becomes various and increases. Therefore, successful interaction design requests deep knowledge about new technology as well as understanding users. It means, by using high technology, building user friendly web environment. Therefore, technology-oriented interaction design might enhance users' understanding and control. In conclusion, the new web environment or Web 2.0 opens more chances for users to communicate with systems and at the same time needs changes in design patterns in order to actualize users' more successful and easier communication, that is, usability. This usability can be established by the design elements and principles-oriented graphic design, the interface design having a balance between new requirements of business and technology, and the interaction design resulting from deep understanding users and information technology. Considering all information design levels, the utmost usability probably seems to go toward digital warm, humane design. Then, next a decade later, what can we expect for usability? A Xerox PARC scientist, Alan Kay said ""the best way to predict the future is to invent it."" Between the advancing technology and the people who will use it stand designers and their duty is shaping and guiding the future into humane forms.",3,

 Have you ever experienced a feeling that makes you fascinated and thrilled when you are watching a movie? If so, what do you think made you feel that way? In other words, what components in a movie attract people? Some people say that all the good movies have good actors and actresses, some say that a great director is the most important. However, there are a lot of examples of movies that had had great actors and actresses or a director, but failed to even get people's attentions. Why it happens? The answer is easy and simple. In fact, the people who direct or act are all only small parts of a movie. There are more important things that not only constitute a movie but also make it more interesting and exciting: a realistic plot, dynamic and various kinds of characters, and an unpredictable development.

 The first main component is a realistic plot. A movie is a creation. A world in a movie isn't real but an imagination, and viewers, of course, expect some incidents which could not happen in the real world. They expect almost impossible things such as love between a prince and a poor, but pretty and kind, girl, the end of the earth, and an emergence of aliens. However, the fact that a movie is a creation and it shows only imaginations doesn't mean a story in a movie could be nonsensical. A movie must be realistic. Imagine a story about a man who has been subsided but one day, becomes a billionaire without any probabilities. The movie has to have the reason that he could be a billionaire. For instance, he could win the first prize in a public lottery or could inherit an enormous property from one of his very distant relative who he has never known before. When the movie shows the reason like one of those as the story progresses, people could understand and agree with the story. However, if the reason he has become a billionaire is unreasonable, or illogical, people may not be interested in the story. For example, if he picked up billions of dollars on the street, who feels it could possibly happen? It is very important to make viewers agree with the story because if not, the movie might fail to gather people. When people meet with a realistic plot, people totally adapt to the story of the movie.

 The second crucial component is dynamic and various kinds of characters. Generally, there are two kinds of characters. One is a character that doesn't change all throughout the movie. It is very hard for these kinds of characters to attract people because things that the characters can show viewers are limited. People might be bored and nobody might see a movie if characters in the movie show the same acts and characters. On the contrary, there is a character that changes dynamically from the beginning to the end of a movie. These kinds of characters make people concentrate on a movie and have expectations about the future story because it is so interesting to see the characters change or predict how they are going to change. A character's change can be considered that it is replaced by a new character. For that reason, it often becomes important turning point of a movie. This also causes new accidents continuously, and they make a movie more exciting. For example, if a hero of a movie is an egoistic and stingy person and the character does not change until the end of the movie even he has experienced lots of things such as real love, good friendship, or unexpected kindness, the movie may fails to gather people. The character of the man in the movie has to change slowly and positively as he has experienced those kinds of feelings and accidents, and finally, he has to regret his attitudes and be a generous person. Then the people who watch the movie could be impressed deeply as seeing the process that the man changes his thoughts and attitudes toward his surroundings and life. Like this, changes of characters' move people by making a movie dynamic and active.

 The last important component that makes a movie more interesting and exciting is an unpredictable development. People expect a movie to show them new and innovative things all the time. They think that the movies that they can easily imagine the end are boring. They want a movie to surprise them by setting unpredictable accidents up. Actually, the movies that anybody can predict what is going to happen cannot attract people's attentions at all. A director has to prepare reversed points in all parts of the movie to catch viewers' napping. For sure, not every movie that gives hints explicitly in it or predictable cannot get people's attentions. There are movies that have been loved and called as noted films without any reversed points. They are, however, only a few. Most of good movies have to have several reversed points with unpredictable development in order to give viewers satisfaction and pleasure of being caught in a trap delightfully at many points, especially the end parts of the movies. Viewers might be struck with wonder and might talk about the story again and again after that kind of movie whether they have guessed right the director's traps or not-actually guessing right or not doesn't matter to them because if they've guessed right, they might talk about their farseeing intelligence and if they've made a wrong guess, they at least could talk about the director's intelligence and skillfulness. In this way, an unpredictable development in a movie functions as a thing that repeatedly reminds people of the movie.

 In conclusion, a realistic plot, dynamic and various kinds of characters, and an unpredictable development are the core components to make a good movie. Most of the movies that have been loved and well-known as great movies consist of those three components. Though there are many other components that make a movie dynamic and exciting, they are only tiny things as comparing with those three components. It might be good to try to find these three things in a movie when you watch it. Also, if you consider these three components when you choose a movie next time, you will be able to enjoy watching movie more pleasantly.","Have you ever experienced a feeling that makes you fascinated and thrilled when you are watching a movie?

Y,,17695,cx0,Chinese,Female,349,5,w,2446,1,1358,1333,1333,"Have you ever met this kind of situation that your high school classmate told you that he would not go to a college or university to keep on studying or your friend in the collage told you that he wanted to drop out? What do you think about this? Are you surprise? Do you choose to go to study in a college or university? It is true that more and more students choose to go to college after they finish the study in high school and some of them even spend more years in a graduate school. However, there are still some students choose not to go to college or withdraw in the middle of the study in a college. There are a lot of reasons for this situation. The most common reasons might be that they cannot afford the tuition, they don't like studying, they don't like the life in the college they want to learn something outside the campus and then go back to college or they choose other kind of school.
Nothing will be much sadder to see that a student stop studying because of the economic reason. However it happens every day. No one can deny that the tuition and expense in college is expensive especially the good ones. There are many very good students who work very hard in high school and can get excellent scores in the entrance exam but have to give up the plan of further learning just because they don't have enough money. You might say that are scholarship in universities for these students, but the chances are limited and not all these kind of students can get it. Another fact is that only the big or famous universities can apply many chances of founding for these students while the small ones ore most colleges may not. This is just the situation that assumes the students are outstanding but what if they are just the average level. Can they still get the support from school? The answer may be not. The result of students drop out from college is that they can't find good jobs and get good pays. In the future when their children need money to go to college the economic problem comes out again. Because of this it is normal to see that some families do not have even one college student for many generation. This is sad but the government and some universities are working on this to help more and more poor students to realize their collage dreams.
However there is another kind of students who can afford the expense of college and still give it up because of their different interest. This kind of students do not like study and what they like do not always need to study in the college. For example some students become models or actors from a young age and they really like their jobs, so they choose to give up the collage plan. The youth is more important to their career and they won't choose to waste time in college. I think this is still a good choice because they already get some knowledge from the early study and they begin their career early. What is more important is that when they feel that they want to go back to collage again they still have chance. There are a lot of examples of this situation. Many famous painters, singers, composers don't get their skill from colleges. For instance, one of the famous dancers named Liping ANON_NAME_0 in China has never gone to a university or college to learn dance but she was born to dance. Her most famous solo dance 'the spirit of peacock' cannot be repeated by other dancers until now. So do not go to college do not mean that you cannot succeed and it may save your time and money.
Furthermore some students don't like the life in the college. You must admit that the life in the college is boring. There is restricting schedule you have to follow. You need to get up early every day to go to school, do a lot of homework and prepare for numerous exams and quizzes. So party is so important in the collage life and the students really need something to help them relax. After many years of study in the elementary school and high school some students are really afraid of the studying life and eager to get away from it. However this does not mean that they won't do well in the work. Take my brother for example he went back after only one month in the college and start his career in a company. He learned a lot of thing in the work and now he ever gives lectures to students sometimes. This kind of people is suitable to learn things in the life or in the work. No one can say it is not a good way. Actually they get a lot of things and experience that they can't learn in the class. I have to say people are different and they choose different thing. No one can say what they choose is better or worse. Only they know which one fits them better. I figure that must the reason that the college is not obligation but every children need to go to high school. 
Another possibility is that some students leave the school temporarily to find out what their interests are and what their plan is. It is not rare to see some people do not know what they want to do in the future after high school. They do not know they want to be a doctor, an engineer, or a pharmacy. Because of this they choose to go out to find the dream. After a while, when they experience is enough they may find out what they want to learn and go back to school. You may think it wastes time but it doesn't. It is worth to spend some time to figure out what you really like before you start a major. For example, one of my best friends in high school can't work well for 2 years after he graduated from university as an engineer. Because when he began his career he found out it was not what he wanted and the job was really a devil to him. The 4 years in the college became a waste to him. So do not begin the study in college in hurry. It is possible that the students finally find out which major he want to take or if he want to go to college to take one.

At last people choose professional school instead of college. College and university do not have everything you need. For example you can't learn how to fix a car in it but some student really like this kind of job so they choose other kinds of schools. There no good job and bad job but the job you like and don't, so when you find out you can't get what you need from college you should go find some other place and don't feel bad about that. One of my classmates in high school really wanted to be a chef so he didn't go to college after all. Then he realized his dream. Although he doesn't earn as much as an engineer, he is as happy as anyone.
As I mentioned before, not every people goes to a college or university. The reasons might be object like the economic problem or they might be subject like they don't like study, they don't like the life in the college, they need time to think about the plan before they go to college or they prefer other schools. No matter what the reason is the students have the right to decide their own life. However I hope the government to find out more ways to help the poor students who want to go to college to realize their dreams.

Another fact is that only the big or famous universities can apply many chances of founding for these students while the small ones ore most colleges may not. This is just the situation that assumes the students are outstanding but what if they are just the average level. Can they still get the support from school? The answer may be not. The result of students drop out from college is that they can't find good jobs and get good pays. In the future when their children need money to go to college the economic problem comes out again. Because of this it is normal to see that some families do not have even one college student for many generation. This is sad but the government and some universities are working on this to help more and more poor students to realize their collage dreams. However there is another kind of students who can afford the expense of college and still give it up because of their different interest. This kind of students do not like study and what they like do not always need to study in the college. For example some students become models or actors from a young age and they really like their jobs, so they choose to give up the collage plan. The youth is more important to their career and they won't choose to waste time in college. I think this is still a good choice because they already get some knowledge from the early study and they begin their career early. What is more important is that when they feel that they want to go back to collage again they still have chance. There are a lot of examples of this situation. Many famous painters, singers, composers don't get their skill from colleges. For instance, one of the famous dancers named Liping ANON_NAME_0 in China has never gone to a university or college to learn dance but she was born to dance. Her most famous solo dance 'the spirit of peacock' cannot be repeated by other dancers until now. So do not go to college do not mean that you cannot succeed and it may save your time and money. Furthermore some students don't like the life in the college. You must admit that the life in the college is boring. There is restricting schedule you have to follow. You need to get up early every day to go to school, do a lot of homework and prepare for numerous exams and quizzes. So party is so important in the collage life and the students really need something to help them relax. After many years of study in the elementary school and high school some students are really afraid of the studying life and eager to get away from it. However this does not mean that they won't do well in the work. Take my brother for example he went back after only one month in the college and start his career in a company. He learned a lot of thing in the work and now he ever gives lectures to students sometimes. This kind of people is suitable to learn things in the life or in the work. No one can say it is not a good way. Actually they get a lot of things and experience that they can't learn in the class. I have to say people are different and they choose different thing. No one can say what they choose is better or worse. Only they know which one fits them better. I figure that must the reason that the college is not obligation but every children need to go to high school. Another possibility is that some students leave the school temporarily to find out what their interests are and what their plan is. It is not rare to see some people do not know what they want to do in the future after high school. They do not know they want to be a doctor, an engineer, or a pharmacy. Because of this they choose to go out to find the dream. After a while, when they experience is enough they may find out what they want to learn and go back to school. You may think it wastes time but it doesn't. It is worth to spend some time to figure out what you really like before you start a major. For example, one of my best friends in high school can't work well for 2 years after he graduated from university as an engineer. Because when he began his career he found out it was not what he wanted and the job was really a devil to him. The 4 years in the college became a waste to him. So do not begin the study in college in hurry. It is possible that the students finally find out which major he want to take or if he want to go to college to take one. At last people choose professional school instead of college. College and university do not have everything you need. For example you can't learn how to fix a car in it but some student really like this kind of job so they choose other kinds of schools. There no good job and bad job but the job you like and don't, so when you find out you can't get what you need from college you should go find some other place and don't feel bad about that. One of my classmates in high school really wanted to be a chef so he didn't go to college after all. Then he realized his dream. Although he doesn't earn as much as an engineer, he is as happy as anyone. As I mentioned before, not every people goes to a college or university. The reasons might be object like the economic problem or they might be subject like they don't like study, they don't like the life in the college, they need time to think about the plan before they go to college or they prefer other schools. No matter what the reason is the students have the right to decide their own life. However I hope the government to find out more ways to help the poor students who want to go to college to realize their dreams. ",3,

 If you observe any changes in the new world you will find ""money"" behind that, think about a lot of changes happen these days, new businesses, even wars in most cases begin as a result of seeking for money. So, in this case where is the money behind this idea? Transforming to ""E"" solutions can invest a lot of money than the money has been spent.

Using just an internet connection which you got for free or bunch of dollars you can save up a lot; let's take an example to clear that out. Imagine that you want to move from one city to another city which requires you to do the following: looking for new home, making flight reservations, moving your stuff, buying new furniture, selling some furniture, packing your luggage, changing your addresses with different companies and government' offices, shipping some packages, opening bank accounts, knowing new friends, knowing the neighborhood that you will be living in, discovering some shops around your new home, and so on and so forth. If you want to do all of these tasks the traditional way it will make you spend so much money, rather than that you can do it in no time through the internet. No body actually would argue with how much money we have saved by using the new tech. even if it requires bunch of dollars at the beginning for small stuff like PC, Laptop or internet connection, all what we can say is: thanks to ""E"" letter it saved a lot of money!
 Through the internet today you can do a lot of things that you were doing before, much easier. Let's take some examples to clarify this idea, using the internet makes you get rid of a lot of paper works, rather than going to the library you can look up in the internet and find the researches, papers and references in a couple of clicks, rather you write your notice in a piece of paper and lose it you can write it in the internet, save and access it anytime anywhere. You can send an email in seconds and send it to someone in the edge of the world without paying a penny for stamps or envelops. In a couple of seconds you can purchase whatever you want, brand new or second hand, with barging or lowest price, sight seen or unseen, and get it shipped to the front door in a couple of days. You can transfer money, review the bank statement, make the payments, check your balance, and take loan in many clicks. You can arrange your trips, making the reservations for flights, hotels, cars, purchase tickets, make the whole itinerary from one website and with best prices for packages all-inclusive! You can call for meeting, know is attending and who is not, use a clean white board without looking for chalks and meet your staff wherever they were in a couple of minutes. All tasks mentioned above, if you wanted to do them the traditional way it such a hassle it takes forever to do them, but thanks again to ""E"" letter it saved a lot of time and made our live much easier.
 In the digital world we actually experience a new world in different prospective, it is smart and intelligence world, in other words you can do things a way you were not able to do the old way or even you have not think once that you will be able to do it that easy. Lets explore more things you can do the smart way; have you ever seek a job before? if you did you absolutely know how killing is that job, but now you can apply for different jobs while you are sitting on your couch. Moreover, you can sell your furniture sight seen without moving it, it is a matter of couple of pictures you submit to some specialized websites. Today, you can register for classes, add, drop, attend, participate, take test and pass the course without leaving your home I wish this was invented long time ago! Nowadays, no paper work you need to fill out if you want to go to any governmental office that provides its services online, even more you might don't need to visit them if you can do every thing online. Much more things you can do a smart and intelligence way with ""E"" prefix just think about anything currently you do manually or traditionally and think about it being done the ""E"" way, it is really the smart world we are so lucky to live through!
 Yet not every thing modern is positive, since it may have two edges there is an expression says: ""double-edged sword"" this term can be used as an expression for anything that can simultaneously help and hinder, as when in sword fighting a person can increase his leverage by putting his hand on the blade, which might win the contest but also result in a wound. Some people did not get along with new technology for different reasons: cultural, low education or other reasons. Even with the most well educated people the technology revolution is growing very fast people can not catch up today with every new technology, it is simply overwhelming sometimes, this is undeniable. As a result, what should we do towards that? Should we stop the technology from new creating new inventions? We can not! Should we close our minds with the old traditional ways? This is even worse, it is simply stepping backwards. Actually people need to live with it try to learn and take advantage of it as much as they can. It is really worth it and every thing on the earth has positive and negative sides.
 Besides all the benefits that people get from living in a digital world, yet there are some negative side effects that may harm the world in different ways according to some new studies. One of the negative effects that may harm the society is collapsing the social emotions between people, since every thing now can be done electronically and no need for the people to meet each other or to socialize, this starts to make the relationships between people more weaker which may lead to an unconnected society. As a result the, people will be more rude with each other even though there is a social networks started to take place in the internet nowadays. These social networks may resolve somehow some results that came out of negative side of digital society. 
 Finally, in spite of all causes and effects that came with the moving towards this revolution we have to live with it, not to avoid it, and try to get as much advantages as we can and in the other side avoid the disadvantages as much as we can.

Y,,17867,fg8,Chinese,Female,349,5,w,2446,1,1300,1278,1278,"Have you ever dreamed that you will meet a perfect soul mate, marry him or her and make up a happy family throughout your life as the princess and the prince do in fairy stories when you were young? I believe it would be a lot of people's dream. However, with the development of the society, the situation seems to be more complicated, so this dream becomes more difficult to realize. Nowadays, the divorce rate in every country is increasing gradually, and that of Taiwan is also not exceptional. According to the statistic, Taiwan has had the highest divorce rate in Asia for many years. This phenomenon is surprising. Divorce was not allowed in the traditional Chinese culture. As a result of the pressure of extended family and traditional ethic, couples had to maintain their marriages reluctantly. Why could the situation change so much? What causes Taiwan to have the high divorce rate? In my opinions, the reasons resulting in the high divorce rate in Taiwan include women's increased consciousness, the amendment of Taiwanese legislation and frequent infidelity. 

First of all, women's increased consciousness is one important cause for high divorce rate in Taiwan. A Chinese proverb says, ""If a woman marries a chicken, all she has to do is to follow the chicken."" In the traditional Chinese society, women's social status was very low because women were regarded as men's property. Another Chinese proverb says, ""Women without talent, abilities and opinions are moral."" In the past, Taiwanese women were educated in concerning about their husbands and their families. Their primary jobs were to take care of their family and to cook for their family at home. They tolerated any unfair and horrible treatments, such as family violence, because they considered themselves to be a property of their husbands or their families. Also, they thought their husbands made money to raise their families, so they should obey and follow their husbands' any decisions even if they thought the decisions were not accurate or proper. 

However, Taiwanese women's attitudes to their marriages have changed significantly since their opportunity to get education increases. Now, women have the same right to have well and high education with men which causes women to have their own opinions. They get diverse information from schools or mass media, such as TV shows. Gradually, the focus of their life switches from their families to their jobs. They have their jobs to make money for the economic independence. They do not consider that they belong to their husbands. On the account of their increasing consciousness, they will strive to rights and declare their positions when they face the unfair treatments. When they have arguments with their husbands, they will not compromise easily and be the disadvantaged side like the previous traditional Taiwanese women. Besides, some of my female friends who divorced their ex-husbands told me that one reason leading them to divorce is that they felt unhappy in their marriages. If they do not have a happy or satisfied marriage, they incline to divorce to pursue their freedom and happiness. 

In addition, legislation is another reason to cause the high divorce rate in Taiwan. The former legal provisions about divorce were very strict, so it was not easy for couple to divorce. It stipulated that couples should not allow to divorce unless one of them makes a crucial mistake. Nevertheless, the present Taiwanese legislation has been amended with the tendency. Now the law stipulated that couples could be allowed to divorce if one of them can offer a fair reason to claim that their marriage should not be maintained. Consequently, the amendments contributed to divorcing easily. Also, justices always judged children's guardianship to the father side in the past. Many women were afraid to lose their children, so they chose to endure unhappiness and suffering in their marriages. Today, the Taiwanese laws are pursuing the equality of men and women. The present legislation stipulates that guardianship would be judged to the father or the mother depend on the one who can provide the children with the good growing environment or who has better economic condition. At present, many women perform better than men do, and they might be paid with high salary. It means that women still could own children's guardianship if they sue for divorce. Because of these reasons, the amendment of the legislation would trigger the high divorce rate in Taiwan. 

Last, frequent infidelity is another essential cause to lead the high divorce rate in Taiwan. Nowadays, the interpersonal relationship becomes more complicated and the interaction between people is frequent. Because of women's independence, they also work out which makes people have more opportunities to meet the opposite sex. They spend a lot of time working with their colleagues or cooperators, which might make them fall in love easily. In Taiwan, many men have to work in China, but their families still stay in Taiwan because of the children's education. They just lived alone in China. They might know other women through work. Lonely people are attracted easily by the opposite sex around them. My ex-colleague is an example. Now he always stays with his lover in China, and sends some money to his wife to support his family. Besides, many people depend on the Internet. The Internet also offers people chances to make friends on the virtual world. They might be able to make friends in the chat room. Instead of talking with or communicating with their husbands or wives, some people would like to tell their friends their secrets on the Internet. Also, people's moral ideas become more diminished, so infidelity occurs more frequently. 
In the past Taiwanese society, if a husband has infidelity, his wife would choose to keep silence to maintain their marriage. However, the present women have their own thinking and ideas, they will not tolerate to share husbands with other women. If their husbands do not break up with their girl friends, most of them will decide to end their marriage. Thus, infidelity occurs frequently and women do not pretend to be ignorant which lead a couple to divorce. 

In conclusion, the traditional Chinese concept that everyone should just have a marriage throughout his or her whole life, especially for women, has changed. With the change of the environment, Taiwan still has the high divorce rate inevitably. The first reason is women's increased consciousness. Now the Taiwanese women will not bear so much as the traditional Taiwanese women. They have their own ideas and they will not depend on their husbands. They have their own jobs, so they do not have to worry about their economic conditions if they divorce their husbands. Because of those, they could end their marriage in divorce bravely. In addition, the amendment of Taiwanese legislation is another reason to result in Taiwanese high divorce rate. It loosens the restriction on divorce. If you can claim a reason which harmed you, you might be able to sue for divorce easily. Also Taiwan legislation has been pursuing in the equality of men and women for many years. Women also could win their children's guardianship which makes women propose to divorce bravely. Last, frequent infidelity also results in divorce. Infidelity occurs more frequently at present because the interaction between people increases and becomes complicated. Yet, no one wants to share their mates with other, so they decide to divorce their husbands or wives. Although divorce is common and become easier in the circumstance, we should take this decision serious. Divorcing is a big deal for a person. Nevertheless, it would influence not only the couple but also their children, their whole family and even the society. ","Have you ever dreamed that you will meet a perfect soul mate, marry him or her and make up a happy family throughout your life as the princess and the prince do in fairy stories when you were young? I believe it would be a lot of people's dream. However, with the development of the society, the situation seems to be more complicated, so this dream becomes more difficult to realize.

In the traditional Chinese society, women's social status was very low because women were regarded as men's property. Another Chinese proverb says, ""Women without talent, abilities and opinions are moral."" In the past, Taiwanese women were educated in concerning about their husbands and their families. Their primary jobs were to take care of their family and to cook for their family at home. They tolerated any unfair and horrible treatments, such as family violence, because they considered themselves to be a property of their husbands or their families. Also, they thought their husbands made money to raise their families, so they should obey and follow their husbands' any decisions even if they thought the decisions were not accurate or proper. However, Taiwanese women's attitudes to their marriages have changed significantly since their opportunity to get education increases. Now, women have the same right to have well and high education with men which causes women to have their own opinions. They get diverse information from schools or mass media, such as TV shows. Gradually, the focus of their life switches from their families to their jobs. They have their jobs to make money for the economic independence. They do not consider that they belong to their husbands. On the account of their increasing consciousness, they will strive to rights and declare their positions when they face the unfair treatments. When they have arguments with their husbands, they will not compromise easily and be the disadvantaged side like the previous traditional Taiwanese women. Besides, some of my female friends who divorced their ex-husbands told me that one reason leading them to divorce is that they felt unhappy in their marriages. If they do not have a happy or satisfied marriage, they incline to divorce to pursue their freedom and happiness. In addition, legislation is another reason to cause the high divorce rate in Taiwan. The former legal provisions about divorce were very strict, so it was not easy for couple to divorce. It stipulated that couples should not allow to divorce unless one of them makes a crucial mistake. Nevertheless, the present Taiwanese legislation has been amended with the tendency. Now the law stipulated that couples could be allowed to divorce if one of them can offer a fair reason to claim that their marriage should not be maintained. Consequently, the amendments contributed to divorcing easily. Also, justices always judged children's guardianship to the father side in the past. Many women were afraid to lose their children, so they chose to endure unhappiness and suffering in their marriages. Today, the Taiwanese laws are pursuing the equality of men and women. The present legislation stipulates that guardianship would be judged to the father or the mother depend on the one who can provide the children with the good growing environment or who has better economic condition. At present, many women perform better than men do, and they might be paid with high salary. It means that women still could own children's guardianship if they sue for divorce. Because of these reasons, the amendment of the legislation would trigger the high divorce rate in Taiwan. Last, frequent infidelity is another essential cause to lead the high divorce rate in Taiwan. Nowadays, the interpersonal relationship becomes more complicated and the interaction between people is frequent. Because of women's independence, they also work out which makes people have more opportunities to meet the opposite sex. They spend a lot of time working with their colleagues or cooperators, which might make them fall in love easily. In Taiwan, many men have to work in China, but their families still stay in Taiwan because of the children's education. They just lived alone in China. They might know other women through work. Lonely people are attracted easily by the opposite sex around them. My ex-colleague is an example. Now he always stays with his lover in China, and sends some money to his wife to support his family. Besides, many people depend on the Internet. The Internet also offers people chances to make friends on the virtual world. They might be able to make friends in the chat room. Instead of talking with or communicating with their husbands or wives, some people would like to tell their friends their secrets on the Internet. Also, people's moral ideas become more diminished, so infidelity occurs more frequently. In the past Taiwanese society, if a husband has infidelity, his wife would choose to keep silence to maintain their marriage. However, the present women have their own thinking and ideas, they will not tolerate to share husbands with other women. If their husbands do not break up with their girl friends, most of them will decide to end their marriage. Thus, infidelity occurs frequently and women do not pretend to be ignorant which lead a couple to divorce. In conclusion, the traditional Chinese concept that everyone should just have a marriage throughout his or her whole life, especially for women, has changed. With the change of the environment, Taiwan still has the high divorce rate inevitably. The first reason is women's increased consciousness. Now the Taiwanese women will not bear so much as the traditional Taiwanese women. They have their own ideas and they will not depend on their husbands. They have their own jobs, so they do not have to worry about their economic conditions if they divorce their husbands. Because of those, they could end their marriage in divorce bravely. In addition, the amendment of Taiwanese legislation is another reason to result in Taiwanese high divorce rate. It loosens the restriction on divorce. If you can claim a reason which harmed you, you might be able to sue for divorce easily. Also Taiwan legislation has been pursuing in the equality of men and women for many years. Women also could win their children's guardianship which makes women propose to divorce bravely. Last, frequent infidelity also results in divorce. Infidelity occurs more frequently at present because the interaction between people increases and becomes complicated. Yet, no one wants to share their mates with other, so they decide to divorce their husbands or wives. Although divorce is common and become easier in the circumstance, we should take this decision serious. Divorcing is a big deal for a person. Nevertheless, it would influence not only the couple but also their children, their whole family and even the society. ","Have you ever dreamed that you will meet a perfect soul mate, marry him or her and make up a happy family throughout your life as the princess and the prince do in fairy stories when you were young? I believe it would be a lot of people's dream. However, with the development of the society, the situation seems to be more complicated, so this dream becomes more difficult to realize. Nowadays, the divorce rate in every country is increasing gradually, and that of Taiwan is also not exceptional. According to the statistic, Taiwan has had the highest divorce rate in Asia for many years. This phenomenon is surprising. Divorce was not allowed in the traditional Chinese culture. As a result of the pressure of extended family and traditional ethic, couples had to maintain their marriages reluctantly. Why could the situation change so much? What causes Taiwan to have the high divorce rate? In my opinions, the reasons resulting in the high divorce rate in Taiwan include women's increased consciousness, the amendment of Taiwanese legislation and frequent infidelity. First of all, women's increased consciousness is one important cause for high divorce rate in Taiwan.

 Many people describe a friend as the people who have the same hobbies, interests, and who like the same activities, such as sports and games. I think that these factors can make a relationship closely and friendly, however I don't think that this is the real meaning of a friend.
 I have a friend who is living in Chicago now. We met each other when we were only 8 years old. When I was in elementary school's classroom, I saw him first. Surprisingly, we were living in the same apartment building. This is one reason that we became good friends. He was my first Korean friend whose name is John Moon. We attended the same elementary, middle and high school which is close to our house. We understood and supported each other when we have not only problems or matters, but also ordinary conversation. Unfortunately, John, who is my soul-mate, moved to Chicago when we were 17 years old. I was so sad; however it wasn't a big problem, because we knew that even distance can't interrupt our friendship. He goes to Korea every vacation; also when I joined military service for two years, he went to Korea to meet me. I can perceive what's happening to him or what he wants without saying any words, only eye-contact, although we couldn't meet each other for a long time. 
 A meaning of a friend could be a person who shares their feelings, a person who enjoys their daily-life together. However, the real friend's meaning I think is ""My life"". Sometimes we can count on each other, sometimes we have to be the first person who makes him/her to do the right thing, because it's also my life, just like John and me. Between the real friends, the one thing that they need is not saying or doing, it's existing.

I can not remember that how we became friends, but I remember she was a student who was very smart, and friendly. I could easily talk about my concern. We did not end up in the same high school and university, but we easily met up. She lived in the apartment which is a minute walking away from my home.

That is the real friend."" It sounds weird, but it means that best friend have to share a shame. My best friend Mee-jin was in the class in my 7th grade. She is the person who I spent half of my life with. I spent my immature years (my school life) with her. I can not remember that how we became friends, but I remember she was a student who was very smart, and friendly. I could easily talk about my concern. We did not end up in the same high school and university, but we easily met up. She lived in the apartment which is a minute walking away from my home. Even though now we are apart, we still talk to each other on messenger. I really appreciate that she is my friend. Now she has a problem which is related with her boy friend, who serves in the military. I hope she can resolve that problem. I really miss her. ","Have you ever heard of the Irish blessing? ""There are many types of ships. There are wooden ships, plastic ships, and metal ships. But the best and most important ships are friendships."" I fully agree with this saying and it is my favorite proverb. People are social animals, which mean we can not live alone and we have to live with people. Friends are energy of our life we are not lonely because of our friends. Also, friends are listeners. They listen to our worries and sometimes they give us advice and news.

 A writer once said that friends are born, not 

made. I think he meant that friendship is like 

love at first sight. We become friends immediately 

with people who are compatible with us. I do not 

agree with this writer because I have made friends 

with some people who were completely different 

from me. In addition, coincidences in life have 

made the friendships even more interesting and 

special.

 In October 6, 2005, my children and I went 

to Pittsburgh to a party which was given by a 

Latino group. They celebrated different 

traditions that were from different countries like 

Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. After I arrived 

there, I saw a lot of families and children who 

were very happy. My kids were having a good time, 

and I was also. There were people who were helping 

the kids to make crafts and dance. While my 

children were busy I started talking with a very 

nice lady who was from Peru. At first, we talked 

about our mothers, who live in Pittsburgh with us,

and how important they are in our lives. 

Suddenly, my kids were running towards me, but 

they were not running alone. A beautiful girl who 

had blond hair, and whose eyes looked like the 

blue sky was coming with them. They were very 

happy because they had made a new friend. I was 

surprised that this beautiful girl with blue eyes 

was the granddaughter of my new friend from Peru. 

Since then, my children love to have play times 

with her granddaughter and we have become very 

good friends not only with her, but with her 

mother who has a very special place in my heart. 

 
 Although we have different backgrounds and 

different ages, we share a special friendship 

because of the way we met. In fact, our 

friendship, which grows stronger every day, is not 

based on our differences but on the respect we 

have for each other. Friendship is a gift that 

brings people together, and I am fortunate to meet 

by coincidence my very special friends from Peru.

 A writer once said, ""a friend in need is a friend indeed."" I think he meant that to some people, friendship is valued by what you can do for them, not by who you are. I agree with this writer because my husband and I have made friendships with some people who have abused the real meaning of our friendship. 
 A few years ago, my husband introduced me to a person, whose name was John. John, who was a plumber, worked for us fixing things in our business. At first, he seemed to be a very nice person with whom our family became friends. Afterwards, my son, who loved to play with John, wanted him to be his godfather and he accepted. In the church, where my son was christened, we invited all of our family. John, who looked very nice, came early, so we had time to talk and laugh. We really had a good time, but John, that had looked so happy, started feeling sad. John, who was 44 years old, had never had many serious relationships, which he thought was very strange for his age. He thought that nobody could love him because physically he was not attractive. John was bald, so he always wore a baseball cap to cover his head. Scott, who is my husband, helped to bring his self-esteem back. He started looking for a girlfriend, who could love him for who he was instead of how he looked. He dated and fell in love with a lady, who worked in another restaurant. After dating for a while, John and his girlfriend, whose name was Amy, were having problems. Every day, John visited my husband at our restaurant, and he would talk to Scott about his problems, which were many, about his relationship with Amy. My husband, who listened carefully, always took his time to give John good advice. Nevertheless, John's relationship was falling apart, and his girlfriend, who moved away, left him without hope. We spent more time with him during that period, because he looked very depressed. In addition, he told us that he was broke, which was a very difficult situation for him. Then, John asked us to lend him money to pay his bills and promised to pay us back as soon as he could. We agreed to loan him the money, which has never been paid back. In the end, my son lost his godfather, John lost our friendship, and we lost our trust in John.

First of all, the life of the military can help men become independent. In my country, women often says that a man who do not serve in the army is not a man because he behave like a child. Men who are in the military should take care of himself. Before serving in the military, they might live with their family or friends. Their families and friends will give them assistance if they face some problems, However, they should deal with their problems by themselves when they serve in the military. They should be responsible for their superiors. Take my brother and my cousin as examples. Before my brother serve in the military, he was depend on my parents since my parents did anything for him. He always followed my parents' suggestions even they were wrong. After serving in the military, he becomes more independent, and has his own ideas.

In addition, men can realice how to cooperate with others through their lives in the army. Nowadays, everyone emphasizes on the importance of teamwork. The life of the military can train men to get used to the group work in advance before they start working in companies. A military is like a small society.

People tend to judge other people based mainly on which ethnic group or nationality they belong to. Stereotypes have both good and bad effects. Sometimes these steroeotypes are very helpful, but often they are negative and harmful.
 On the one hand, stereotypes are helpful. Because they are formed with a developing stage. People got some impressions and ideas from communicating with other people from different ethnic or nationality. They usually summarized and found some general rule about other people with different ethnic or nationality. Generally speaking, stereotypes are helpful when people judge other people from different groups or nationalities because they can get quick impression and reaction how to deal with other people, especially when people didn't have many knowledge about the characteristics of other people from different ethnic or nationality people.
 On the other hand, stereotypes are negative and harmful. Because stereotypes are not the exactly summary of characteristics of other peoples from different ethnic or nationality. People's behavior and characteristic are not the same just because they belong to one ethnic or nationality although they have many common things. People judge other people just depending on their ethnic or nationality they belong to, people will make mistake and get wrong decision, so these stereotypes are negative and harmful. For example, people may have stereotypes of American and think all of them are rich and hardworking. In fact some people are rich and hard working, but somes are not.
 In summary, stereotypes have both good and bad effects. The important thing is how we use them. We can use stereotypes as a general imagation of other peoples, but we also think about the details and individuals.","Stereotypes have a long history and exist commonly in many societies today.

Some of them are even crying. The reason why they look very sad is that today is the day which ANON_NAME_0 starts serving in the army for 2 years. They cry and cry again. His dad , who already quit the serve about 20years ago, are so sad as well because he knows what the army is. Does army that makes people sad deserve it much? In fact, there are some awful aspects and disadvantage of it, namely, wasting time, hurting men's body and spirit and separating from lovely people.

 In Korea, for most men it is mandatory to serve in army, navy or air force approximately for 2years. Since the government wants healthy people for army, many of them go into the army when they are very young like 20 or 21. During the beginning of 20's people prepare a lot of things for the future like studying, health, going through many hardship. On account of the government, men are called to army at that young age. While the government wants them for nation's wealth, it wastes the important resource of nation which is a person.

 Even though the circumstance of army is getting better and better, it is not really good and proper for people yet. For example, there are sill much violence in army, so people hurt easily during the period. Even in 21century, a physical violence still exists. The government is not willing to notice everything in army though, many severe accidents including killing people are shown on the News. Also, some people finishing the service might not adjust to society on account of fear out of an army. They might live forever with the fear which is from army. 

 Last, to get into an army, they must be separated from their lovely people. Can you imagine that people are separated from lovely family and girl friend or boy friend by a force? It hurts people so much.


 Is it necessary for men to serve in the army? If so, for whom or what? Of course some people might say that children becomes real men through the army. However, it is just very small part of it and there is nothing more important than a person.

Have you ever heard like these saying ""Black can sing."" or ""Teenagers are too young to make a decision about their life""? There have been so many kinds of stereotypes not only about minorities of a society, but also about almost all the nationalities. Although these stereotypes sometimes are positive things, they can influence strongly negative effects on a particular nations in most case. Why do these stereotypes exist? The reason could be explained by 2 ways: the effects of historical facts and mass medias.

First, stereotypes usually have come from historical facts. For example, Korea was invaded by Japan and China lots of time thoughout its history and Koreans couldn't have enough time to develop contemporary industries comparing other countries. They've worked very hard in order to catch up with other countries. As a result, Koreans now become having a stereotype that ""Koreans spend their most of time to work."" Though they don't work hard today as much as they did in the past, people in the world still think the stereotype is true because it has existed for a long time.

Second, mass medias often cause stereotypes. In many films, Asians are described as the people who love only money. They consider how they can make more money and win a lottery. It is not true and nobody knows where the stereotype came from. However, it is considered seriously just due to ""a film shows people such that way."" Since the power of mass medias is really strong, everyone cannot help accepting the information that is in them such as TV dramas or films as a truth.

In conclusion, there have been a lot of unreliable and unreasonable stereotypes about nationalities which came from historical facts and mass medias. Because they've existed too long, it might seem almost impossible to get rid of them from everyone's mind. However, they should removed because of their terrible effects upon the images of nationalities and the relationships and interactions between nations all over the world. If we try to accept stereotypes from all the ways carefully and thoughtfully, we must be able to close to each other.","Have you ever heard like these saying ""Black can sing."" or ""Teenagers are too young to make a decision about their life""?

Y,C1245,18354,cx0,Chinese,Female,349,5,w,2525,1,1232,1215,1215,"Are you an international student? Have you ever taken a TOEFL test? If your answer is yes you may want to tell me that TOFEL is an evil. That is true, but more and more students take this test. I think nobody likes TOEFL but people do not have choice. TOEFL score is the main requirement for international students to enter a university, so no matter how good you are it is impossible to get into a university without this English score. I took this test two years ago. I have to say I spent a lot of time on preparing it. Although I got a pretty good score I really do not want to take it again. I think it is a torture to most of the students. However when I began my study in the United States I found out that we do need this terrible test to help international student adapt to the new life in an English speaking country.
First of all international students need basic English to live in a foreign country. TOEFL is about daily language and we cannot live without talking to other people every day. When you want an apartment you need to talk to a land lord. If you get lost, you need to ask people for help. When you have some new friends, you need to talk more. So if your English is not enough, you may find that everything in your life is a mess. However, I am not saying that once you pass the TOEFL test there is not trouble for you to begin a new life in a strange place. It is just better. For example my friend moved to the United States with parents so she didn't need a TOFEL. Nevertheless when she got here, she found it is hard for her to live. She can't talk to her classmate, so she felt lonely. She had a big problem with her study, so she lost her confidence. Every time she talked about this, she said she should have learned more English in China. It is hard for people to learn another language. You do not have an environment to practice what you have learned, so the improvement is very slowly. Without a force people may give up easily. That is the reason we have TOFEL. It is the same as we have midterm and final term. People hate it but still need it to guarantee the quality of study. For me, although I do not like TOEFL I still want to thank it because it really helps me to begin a wonderful life here.
Furthermore, if you are taught in English you can't do it well without learning enough English. If you think the listening part in the TOFEL is hard, then a real scientific class in English will be horrible. Your major is the most important thing when you are in school, so you can't let the language become the biggest problem. Take me for example. The most difficult course I took last semester is Epidemiology just because it needs more English. This subject is not hard and I even learned some of it before in China. However I can't get everything in the class or I misunderstood many times. In the test I lost scores because I didn't get the right meaning of the questions. On the contrast, I did very well in the math class, although it is always my weakest subject, because I do not need much language in math. Some of my friends in department of Epidemiology find it is hard to do presentation, so I think it is totally right that the new TOFEL has speaking test. This test does not mean to make students feel bad otherwise it prevent you from feeling bad in the future.
In addition, TOFEL as a standard English test is fair to every student whose native language is not English. Some people may say that we do not need English if we learn it well at school but who will and how to decide if a person learns English well. It is hard to judge. In China Students begin to have English classes at least since junior high school. For some people like me English study began in elementary school. Most of the students have taken a long time English school and their level is different. It is obvious that we can't decide a student's second language level basing on the years he has learn it or the scores in finals, because time can't represent the quality and different school has different finals. To these students, no matter how long they have learned English no matter what score they got in finals, the TOFEL is a fair game to everybody and it gives admit committees a good evidence to show how good a student is. For instance some high school students can get a pretty good score in TOFEL while some college students can't even past the test. That is why a standard test is important.
Although TOFEL is a test, we also learn something from it. The English in TOFEL is a good resource for you to learn how people speak English or write in English. For example, in the listening part if you pay more attention to these dialogues, you will find these sentences are what you will definitely use when you study in American. Most of the dialogues happen between classmates or friends so when you test your listening, you improve your speaking at the same time. In the reading part, do not just focus on answering the question because you shouldn't miss these good examples of English writing. When my teacher told me that I should find thesis statement in the first paragraph of an English essay not the last paragraph as in Chinese and the topic sentences are usually the first sentences in the body, I just remember these rules as test skills. Finally I thought I need learn something from all these great essays, and then I realized I need to write like this. The better my reading was the better my writing was. It is like that I can improve different abilities at the same time. I think TOFEL is also a way to help students learn English better.
The opponent of TOFEL might say that it is cruel to decide if a student could study abroad based on a language test. However English is so important, especially all the classes are in it, that we really need to find a way to know what level a student's English is. TOFEL may not the best way but it is most effective ever since. I think we need to keep it.
There are many reasons of requiring TOFEL score and it is indeed necessary. At the beginning, it is may only professors thinking TOFEL score is important to judge a student, but finally when the student steps on the land of American he will be happy about that he had learned a lot of English before. If there is no better way comes out TOFEL will be the only and best method to help a university if a student is qualified. We should support this great test and try to make it better.

For example my friend moved to the United States with parents so she didn't need a TOFEL. Nevertheless when she got here, she found it is hard for her to live. She can't talk to her classmate, so she felt lonely. She had a big problem with her study, so she lost her confidence. Every time she talked about this, she said she should have learned more English in China. It is hard for people to learn another language. You do not have an environment to practice what you have learned, so the improvement is very slowly. Without a force people may give up easily. That is the reason we have TOFEL. It is the same as we have midterm and final term. People hate it but still need it to guarantee the quality of study. For me, although I do not like TOEFL I still want to thank it because it really helps me to begin a wonderful life here. Furthermore, if you are taught in English you can't do it well without learning enough English. If you think the listening part in the TOFEL is hard, then a real scientific class in English will be horrible. Your major is the most important thing when you are in school, so you can't let the language become the biggest problem. Take me for example. The most difficult course I took last semester is Epidemiology just because it needs more English. This subject is not hard and I even learned some of it before in China. However I can't get everything in the class or I misunderstood many times. In the test I lost scores because I didn't get the right meaning of the questions. On the contrast, I did very well in the math class, although it is always my weakest subject, because I do not need much language in math. Some of my friends in department of Epidemiology find it is hard to do presentation, so I think it is totally right that the new TOFEL has speaking test. This test does not mean to make students feel bad otherwise it prevent you from feeling bad in the future. In addition, TOFEL as a standard English test is fair to every student whose native language is not English. Some people may say that we do not need English if we learn it well at school but who will and how to decide if a person learns English well. It is hard to judge. In China Students begin to have English classes at least since junior high school. For some people like me English study began in elementary school. Most of the students have taken a long time English school and their level is different. It is obvious that we can't decide a student's second language level basing on the years he has learn it or the scores in finals, because time can't represent the quality and different school has different finals. To these students, no matter how long they have learned English no matter what score they got in finals, the TOFEL is a fair game to everybody and it gives admit committees a good evidence to show how good a student is. For instance some high school students can get a pretty good score in TOFEL while some college students can't even past the test. That is why a standard test is important. Although TOFEL is a test, we also learn something from it. The English in TOFEL is a good resource for you to learn how people speak English or write in English. For example, in the listening part if you pay more attention to these dialogues, you will find these sentences are what you will definitely use when you study in American. Most of the dialogues happen between classmates or friends so when you test your listening, you improve your speaking at the same time. In the reading part, do not just focus on answering the question because you shouldn't miss these good examples of English writing. When my teacher told me that I should find thesis statement in the first paragraph of an English essay not the last paragraph as in Chinese and the topic sentences are usually the first sentences in the body, I just remember these rules as test skills. Finally I thought I need learn something from all these great essays, and then I realized I need to write like this. The better my reading was the better my writing was. It is like that I can improve different abilities at the same time. I think TOFEL is also a way to help students learn English better. The opponent of TOFEL might say that it is cruel to decide if a student could study abroad based on a language test. However English is so important, especially all the classes are in it, that we really need to find a way to know what level a student's English is. TOFEL may not the best way but it is most effective ever since. I think we need to keep it. There are many reasons of requiring TOFEL score and it is indeed necessary. At the beginning, it is may only professors thinking TOFEL score is important to judge a student, but finally when the student steps on the land of American he will be happy about that he had learned a lot of English before. If there is no better way comes out TOFEL will be the only and best method to help a university if a student is qualified. We should support this great test and try to make it better.","Are you an international student? Have you ever taken a TOEFL test? If your answer is yes you may want to tell me that TOFEL is an evil. That is true, but more and more students take this test. I think nobody likes TOEFL but people do not have choice. TOEFL score is the main requirement for international students to enter a university, so no matter how good you are it is impossible to get into a university without this English score. I took this test two years ago. I have to say I spent a lot of time on preparing it. Although I got a pretty good score I really do not want to take it again. I think it is a torture to most of the students. However when I began my study in the United States I found out that we do need this terrible test to help international student adapt to the new life in an English speaking country. First of all international students need basic English to live in a foreign country. TOEFL is about daily language and we cannot live without talking to other people every day. When you want an apartment you need to talk to a land lord. If you get lost, you need to ask people for help. When you have some new friends, you need to talk more. So if your English is not enough, you may find that everything in your life is a mess. However, I am not saying that once you pass the TOEFL test there is not trouble for you to begin a new life in a strange place. It is just better. For example my friend moved to the United States with parents so she didn't need a TOFEL. Nevertheless when she got here, she found it is hard for her to live.

Y,K1652,18353,da3,Korean,Female,349,5,w,2525,1,1086,1048,1044,"After the emergence of the first museum, the Great Library of Alexandria, the first public museums opened during the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment. As if the name of the Great Library of Alexandria represents, the museum's purpose began from providing places for philosophy and research and moved to collecting, reserving and displaying heritages. As a public place, the museum is subject to the public and hence its purpose also connects to movements of a society. Accordingly, definition of the museum has been changed. Then, what should the next generation museum pursuit? An answer to the question will be sought in a relationship between movement of society and purpose of a museum. 
 While the speed of globalization accelerates, relatively, regionalism becomes more conspicuous. In 2001, UNESCO announced 'Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity' and this declaration illustrated the first ""international standard-setting instrument aimed at preserving and promoted cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue"". Additionally, as essence of the post- modern society , most sociologists point out cultural pluralism, multiculturalism and cultural identity . Large societies are comprised of subcultures having distinct sets of behavior and beliefs that differentiate them from a larger culture of which they are a part. That is to say, the uniqueness of subculture results from its territory, its members, or by their age, race, ethnicity, class or gender. Therefore, as the fundamental characteristics of the post- modern society, this cultural uniqueness must be projected and reflected on the next generation museum. Hence, if we regard the aspects of economy, society and culture, the comprehensive eco-museum will be a proper solution. 
First, the comprehensive eco-museum enables to strengthen cultural differences by creating financial profits. While so far most museums have provided visitors limited activities at some designated places in buildings, an eco-museum usually assigns the whole local districts concerned over buildings. Most existing museums have partially contributed to community development by employing some local people and returning a part of interest but comprehensive eco-museums relate to such most factors in a cultural area as artifacts, natural environment and local population. By conserving uniqueness of local culture or subculture, facing against globalization and standardization, the comprehensive eco-museums is considered as a competitive power to keep cultural identity. Thus, by commercializing these cultural resources, entire local communities directly connect to the development profits and these returned profits are re-input to reinforce cultural assets as a way of community development. For example, when construction of Guizhou Eco-Museum began in 1995, the Chinese government elucidated a financial ground as promoting economy of Guizhou local community. Consequently, by underpinning the revenue of local communities, the comprehensive eco-museum can support conservation of traditional local culture.
Second, when it comes to social aspects of a comprehensive eco-museum, it means consolidation of social solidarity. The tradition and heritage of a local community are dissolved in the community members' lives. Thus, since the comprehensive eco-museum is subject to the local community, its members are direct owners of its cultural capital and at the same time they have responsibilities for preserving their tradition and heritage. Therefore, the comprehensive eco-museum requests local population's participation and its co-operation with the local government. This cooperative system can not only increase the quality of museum but also raise the community members' cultural pride and confirm member's solidarity. The Skansen museum in Sweden demonstrated the successful solidarity. In fact, the development of this museum was initiated by local population's involvement. The local community members asserted conservation of their natural environment as heritage and later they obtained the support of the Swedish government and specialists. Located on the island Djurgården in Stockholm, the Skansen museum is the first ""open air museum"" and zoo in Sweden. It was founded in 1891 by Artur Hazelius to show the way of life in the different parts of Sweden before the industrial era. In this case, the cultural pride of the local population led to constructing the museum and then it implies that the comprehensive eco museum, needing cooperation of community, boosts communication between the local community members and finally, confirms solidarity of community. Accordingly, by drawing attention and co-operation of a local community, the comprehensive eco-museum contributes to raising the community's pride toward regional culture. 
Last, in terms of cultural aspects, the comprehensive eco-museum enlarges the conservation range of a local community's heritage and tradition. The existing museums have focused on a tangible cultural treasure and it means so far we have neglected an intangible cultural treasure. Although the traditional museums have attempted to represent and show the intangible treasures by multimedia, performance or Walk-Through Diorama, their efforts have faced the matter of the limited realty. In this respect, a comprehensive eco-museum is suggested as a solution. The comprehensive eco-museum's open places without fabrication offer visitors intangible cultural assets in real lives and furthermore it results in conservation and succession of these cultural assets. Ungersheim Alsace Open Air Museum gives a concrete example. Located in France, this museum's themes are working lives in a village of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Visitors can discover the traditional know-how of these far-off days and taste some delicious local products in lively, direct way. 
Opponents to the comprehensive eco-museum might be pessimistic about wide ranging development in that development only means development, not conservation. Thoughtless and excessive development would cause disadvantages. However, this problem can be obviated by a well-organized plan and sustainable development, and blind conservation cannot guarantee diversity of culture. Now, about 300 eco-museums are operating , it demonstrates possibilities of the comprehensive eco-museum. 
In conclusion, according to the movement of society, the function and purpose of a museum have also been changed. Then, concerning culture diversity and cultural identity, what can we expect as the next generation museum? According to Georges Henri Rivière, who provided the theoretical base of eco-museum movement, ""An eco-museum is a mirror for the local population to view itself, to discover its own image, and in which it seek an explanation of territory to which it is attached and of the population that have proceeded it. "" Hence, the comprehensive eco-museum can reinforce a community culture in three aspects. By returning financial profits, raising social solidarity and cultural pride as cultural group and enlarging the range of culture conservation, the eco-museum should be considered as the next generation museum.

Y,,18355,cu2,Spanish,Unknown,349,5,w,2525,1,1951,1862,1861,"Every thing nowadays started to get ""E"" letter as prefix did not you notice? You may know: email, e-tickets, e-banking and other words prefixed with ""E"", yet other new words started to get ""E"" before it you may not expect them to have it. Have you ever heard of e-City, e-Government or even e-Date? It is booming these days and getting wider day after day. So what dose it mean to have this ""E"" before any word? Obviously, being electronic! In other words change the traditional way of providing services, doing businesses, processing data and so on to be in an electronic form. Sounds good, but why every one is eager to transform to become in an ""E"" form? What added value dose it provide? In contrast, there is a resistance to this revolution from who? And why? To answer these questions we need to discuss the pros and cons for this issue throughout this essay.
 If you observe any changes in the new world you will find ""money"" behind that, think about a lot of changes happen these days, new businesses, even wars in most cases begin as a result of seeking for money. So, in this case where is the money behind this idea? Transforming to ""E"" solutions can invest a lot of money than the money has been spent. What made some banks to invest more than billion dollars in information technology solutions is worth it since that investment can bring 10 times more than what has been spent according to some IT watch experts ""IT investment is reflected in improved performance (measured using both standard accounting ratios and cost and alternative profit efficiency measures)."" The same thing in any ""E"" solution has been provided; it can save money in many ways more than what you can imagine when you hear for a first time about it. Using just an internet connection which you got for free or bunch of dollars you can save up a lot; let's take an example to clear that out. Imagine that you want to move from one city to another city which requires you to do the following: looking for new home, making flight reservations, moving your stuff, buying new furniture, selling some furniture, packing your luggage, changing your addresses with different companies and government' offices, shipping some packages, opening bank accounts, knowing new friends, knowing the neighborhood that you will be living in, discovering some shops around your new home, and so on and so forth. If you want to do all of these tasks the traditional way it will make you spend so much money, rather than that you can do it in no time through the internet. No body actually would argue with how much money we have saved by using the new tech. even if it requires bunch of dollars at the beginning for small stuff like PC, Laptop or internet connection. Well I think up to this point you could not agree more, but how can we imagine that some people resist this change? The answer is very simple and it is the same answer: ""money"" yes, people who already invested a lot of money on a specific business that can not be compatible with the new tech. solution they will start to fight this new tech. unless if they try to be positive and convert their current solution to get along with the new tech. take for example VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) tech. a lot of circuit switching companies ""the old tech."" are fighting against this new tech. even more they try to block the ports that facilitate the use for this tech. why? Because they have invested billions of dollars in the old tech.'s infrastructure. So, if there were no regulator in the telecom market the VOIP tech. will never be used. However, there is another kind of resistance besides; it has to do with traditional people who don't want to use any new tech. thing ""As to resistance to change? It's common, but it isn't instinctual, in part because nothing about human behavior is purely instinctual -everything is a complex interplay between genes and environment. Employees resist change because, in the absence of communication, they assume the worst. In their experience, change means layoffs or longer hours, while executives receive the bonuses and accolades.
Employees resist change because the information they have tells them they ought to."" And with those kind of people it about showing them the pros and cons of using the new tech. Anyway all what we can say is: thanks to ""E"" letter it saved a lot of money!
 Besides what mentioned in the previously, through the internet today you can do a lot of things that you were doing before, much easier. Let's take some examples to clarify this idea, using the internet makes you get rid of a lot of paper works, rather than going to the library you can look up in the internet and find the researches, papers and references in a couple of clicks, rather you write your notice in a piece of paper and lose it you can write it in the internet, save and access it anytime anywhere. You can send an email in seconds and send it to someone in the edge of the world without paying a penny for stamps or envelops. In a couple of seconds you can purchase whatever you want, brand new or second hand, with barging or lowest price, sight seen or unseen, and get it shipped to the front door in a couple of days. You can transfer money, review the bank statement, make the payments, check your balance, and take loan in many clicks. You can arrange your trips, making the reservations for flights, hotels, cars, purchase tickets, make the whole itinerary from one website and with best prices for packages all-inclusive!

 Yet not every thing modern is positive, since it may have two edges there is an expression says: ""double-edged sword"" this term can be used as an expression for anything that can simultaneously help and hinder, as when in sword fighting a person can increase his leverage by putting his hand on the blade, which might win the contest but also result in a wound. Some people did not get along with new technology for different reasons: cultural, low education or other reasons for example some people thought the technology will result in lying off people! But it turned on it offered more opportunity than what expected . Even with the most well educated people the technology revolution is growing very fast people can not catch up today with every new technology, it is simply overwhelming sometimes, this is undeniable. As a result, what should we do towards that? Should we stop the technology from new creating new inventions? We can not! Should we close our minds with the old traditional ways? This is even worse, it is simply stepping backwards. Actually people need to live with it try to learn and take advantage of it as much as they can. It is really worth it and every thing on the earth has positive and negative sides.
 Besides all the benefits that people get from living in a digital world, yet there are some negative side effects that may harm the world in different ways according to some new studies. One of the negative effects that may harm the society is collapsing the social emotions between people, since every thing now can be done electronically and no need for the people to meet each other or to socialize, this starts to make the relationships between people more weaker which may lead to an unconnected society. As a result the, people will be more rude with each other even though there is a social networks started to take place in the internet nowadays. These social networks may resolve somehow some results that came out of negative side of digital society. 
 Finally, in spite of all the pros and cons that came with the moving towards this revolution we have to live with it, not to avoid it, and try to get as much advantages as we can and in the other side avoid the disadvantages as much as we can. As a matter of fact the advantages are more and they are covering what may consider a disadvantage. 
","Every thing nowadays started to get ""E"" letter as prefix did not you notice? You may know: email, e-tickets, e-banking and other words prefixed with ""E"", yet other new words started to get ""E"" before it you may not expect them to have it. Have you ever heard of e-City, e-Government or even e-Date? It is booming these days and getting wider day after day. So what dose it mean to have this ""E"" before any word? Obviously, being electronic! In other words change the traditional way of providing services, doing businesses, processing data and so on to be in an electronic form. Sounds good, but why every one is eager to transform to become in an ""E"" form? What added value dose it provide? In contrast, there is a resistance to this revolution from who? And why? To answer these questions we need to discuss the pros and cons for this issue throughout this essay. If you observe any changes in the new world you will find ""money"" behind that, think about a lot of changes happen these days, new businesses, even wars in most cases begin as a result of seeking for money. So, in this case where is the money behind this idea? Transforming to ""E"" solutions can invest a lot of money than the money has been spent. What made some banks to invest more than billion dollars in information technology solutions is worth it since that investment can bring 10 times more than what has been spent according to some IT watch experts ""IT investment is reflected in improved performance (measured using both standard accounting ratios and cost and alternative profit efficiency measures)."" The same thing in any ""E"" solution has been provided; it can save money in many ways more than what you can imagine when you hear for a first time about it. Using just an internet connection which you got for free or bunch of dollars you can save up a lot; let's take an example to clear that out. Imagine that you want to move from one city to another city which requires you to do the following: looking for new home, making flight reservations, moving your stuff, buying new furniture, selling some furniture, packing your luggage, changing your addresses with different companies and government' offices, shipping some packages, opening bank accounts, knowing new friends, knowing the neighborhood that you will be living in, discovering some shops around your new home, and so on and so forth. If you want to do all of these tasks the traditional way it will make you spend so much money, rather than that you can do it in no time through the internet. No body actually would argue with how much money we have saved by using the new tech. even if it requires bunch of dollars at the beginning for small stuff like PC, Laptop or internet connection. Well I think up to this point you could not agree more, but how can we imagine that some people resist this change? The answer is very simple and it is the same answer: ""money"" yes, people who already invested a lot of money on a specific business that can not be compatible with the new tech. solution they will start to fight this new tech. unless if they try to be positive and convert their current solution to get along with the new tech. take for example VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) tech. a lot of circuit switching companies ""the old tech."" are fighting against this new tech. even more they try to block the ports that facilitate the use for this tech. why? Because they have invested billions of dollars in the old tech.'s infrastructure. So, if there were no regulator in the telecom market the VOIP tech. will never be used. However, there is another kind of resistance besides; it has to do with traditional people who don't want to use any new tech. thing ""As to resistance to change? It's common, but it isn't instinctual, in part because nothing about human behavior is purely instinctual -everything is a complex interplay between genes and environment. Employees resist change because, in the absence of communication, they assume the worst. In their experience, change means layoffs or longer hours, while executives receive the bonuses and accolades. Employees resist change because the information they have tells them they ought to."" And with those kind of people it about showing them the pros and cons of using the new tech.

Y,,18357,fg8,Chinese,Female,349,5,w,2525,2,2022,1934,1935,"How many credit cards do you have? How frequent do you use credit cards to pay your payments? Have you even thought that you rely on credit cards too much? In the past, people regarded credit cards as a symbol of social status. With the change of the society, the fact that people have credit cards becomes common at present. According to the statistics of Banking Bureau, Financial Supervisory Commission of Taiwan, each Taiwanese who is eligible to apply for credit cards, also called ""plastic cards"", has 5 to 6 credit cards on average until December of 2005 in Taiwan. It is getting convenient and common for people to use credit cards to buy their consumer goods or to pay the bills. Also, the Nison Report, a research on consumer payment system, showed that 40 percent of deals in the United States was paid by credit cards before 2006, and it predicted that 55 percent of deals in the United Sates until 2011 will be paid by credit cards rather than cash. Apparently, these circumstances express that credit cards play an important role in people's lives gradually. 

Most people believe that credit cards are safe. They do not have to worry about losing cash because they could just have credit cards with them to pay any payments. In fact, however, credit cards are not a safe currency for people. The fact that people rely on credit cards will bring people abundant bad influences and also will hurt the economy of countries. Credit cards will change people's values, raise consumers' debts and increase the risk of disclosing consumers' privacy. 

First of all, credit cards have changed people's values. In the past, people used cash to pay all of their payments. How much money they spent depended on how much money they had. They had to give up the things they wanted especially luxuries if they did not have enough cash. However, as a result of the popularity of credit cards, people can buy anything even if they can not afford to pay such a price. Take Americans as an example. During Christmas holiday, many stores provide customers with a lot of special discount to stimulate consumption. Many Americans take advantage of the good price to buy a lot of products that they might not need, or gifts that just shows they are generous or rich even they do not have enough money. They can buy any merchandise, which might not be necessary or might be luxuries for them, since they have credit cards. Gradually, this kind of situation distorts people's values. 

Adults enjoy shopping, entertainment or spending money first; they start to pursue the expensive goods and compare their belongings, such as cars, jewellery, etc., with others. Parents' behaviors would influence children. Afterwards, the young spend money extravagantly in spite of that they do not have good income. The fact that they spend money does not depend on how much money they have, but how much they desire to have the products instead. 
Besides, the young generation also considers using credit cards as an expression of independence, which means they could do anything by themselves and get rid of their parents. Nevertheless, they forget that using credit cards does not just mean that they become independent, but also they should be responsible for themselves. ""The growing reliance on plastic is also about culture American love freedom. Just as the invention of the mass-produced automobile gave us the freedom to travel wherever or whenever we wished, credit cards allow us to spend money in ways and at the time that work for us. These freedoms, however, make both cars and credit cards dangerous if they are used improperly."" (Gordon & Douglas, 2005, p. 27-29).

Second, credit cards will raise consumers' debts. Many people think that credit cards could help people manage their finance well because using installment payments and minimum payments can make them use their money more flexible or efficient. However, they neglect that they need to pay more interest when they adopt installment payments or minimum payments. The amount of these interests is considerable and burdens these people's financial pressure insidiously. In the United States, according to the statistics, in 2004, credit-card debt totaled $685 billion which has risen by about 70 percent. The rising is surprising. Also, the recent statistics shows that credit-card debt has reached $915 billion in the United States. Many banks in the US have a great deal of bad debt, which makes banks' burden increase. Once banks could not afford the bad debt, it will cause a series of economical problems. Economists predicted that the problems of banks' bad debts will bring more serious damage than those of subprime mortgage. 

Interest is a principal and important source of profit for a credit card company. In Taiwan, the circulating interest rate of credit card debt reaches around 20 percent. Many people could not afford to pay such high interest, which also causes a lot of social problems, such as suicide or public security. These bad debt will result in serious problems which would threaten a country's economy as well. 

Furthermore, debt threatens a lot of families. Many families are incapable of paying interests; their houses even are mortgaged to banks to pay off their debt. In the US, ""Seventy percentage of American families said last year that they are carrying so much debt that it is making their family loves unhappy; three times more young people are worried about going deeply into debt than about a terrorist attack."" (Gordon & Douglas, 2005, p. 27-29) It is easy to tell that the mortgage problem will be getting worse if people still continue to use credit cards improperly or keep losing self-control on sweeping credit cards. 

In addition, credit cards are not only a currency, but also a credit history. ""According to the Associated Credit Bureaus, Inc. (2001) there are about 1 billion credit cards in circulation in the United States today. The American market's largest segment, which covers unsecured credit cards, is geared toward consumers with an established credit history."" (Guseva & Rona-Tas, 2001, p. 623-646) More and more people spend too much money by credit cards paying off their payments, so they choose the method of minimum payment. The fact that people use minimum payment not only let people pay more interests but also hurts people's credit histories. A poor credit historywill bring these people bad influence for their finance. For example, they might not able to apply to mortgage successful when they require money to do their business. 

Last, credit cards will increase the risk of disclosing consumers' privacy. With the popularization of credit cards, credit card companies have abundant of customers' information, such as customers' phone numbers, social security numbers, and so on, so how to protect customers' personal data has become an important issue for credit card companies. As a result of fact, problems of disclosing consumers' privacy have come out seriously. 

There are several ways to lead to the disclosing of consumers' privacy. First, clerks at the stores sweep your card to get your information from the chip of your credit cards when you check out by credit card. They might sell your information, such as your credit card number, your card verification number and so on, to some illegal organizations to make some profits. In addition, some people take some advantage of their jobs at banks to take the credit card customers' data out. They also might sell the information to the illegal organizations. Even credit card companies would do so. They sell your information to do some commerce. For example, your information might be sold to some insurers. Sometimes, sharing customers' information becomes a strategy under the cooperation between companies. Unfortunately, consumer right might be victimized. ""For those companies, your personal information is actually worth more than the products they're selling."" (Detweiler, 2000, p144) Besides, some hackers use their talents for high technology to get some information through the internet. It is very convenient for people to go shopping online, so more people like shopping online and they use credit cards to check out as well. These computer geniuses could steal the information of the people shopping online from cookies. After gathering these data, they also sell people's data to some organizations. 

The illegal organizations which attempt to get the data of credit card customers as much as they can make up credit cards according to these information. They use these fake credit cards to get benefits. It is impossible for the users of credit cards to know credit card frauds immediately. Unfortunately, credit-card fraud has become prevalent since credit cards are popular. Many credit card holders usually have no choice but to be charge the loss of credit card fraud. 

To defeat credit card fraud, many banks also devote to developing the projects to reduce the credit card fraud. For instance, ""HSBC is planning to replace hundreds of fraud detection systems with a single anti-fraud system to monitor bank transactions across 83 operations worldwide. The bank has begun a project in Hong ANON_NAME_0 to adapt credit card fraud detection software to monitor all of its banking products, including credit cards, debit cards, cheques, online and telephone banking and contactless card transactions."" (Flinders, 2007, p1.) Although banks attempt to reduce the credit card fraud and use a lot of security systems and projects to protect their customers from credit card fraud, it is still impossible to guard against fraud and avoid customers' risks completely at present. 

To conclude, nowadays, a lot of people think credit cards are a convenient and safe tool, or currency. They use credit cards anytime and anywhere in their lives. However, credit cards are a dangerous currency because improper abusing credit cards will bring a great amount of risks and bad influences. First, credit cards will distort people's value. People would buy anything thing they want, even though they do not have money. They will pursue material life and enjoy entertainments. For the young generation, they would learn the value from their parents or their peers. Also, they would abuse credit cards to show they have been adults. They do learn how to use credit card well. 

Second, credit cards will raise consumers' debts. Many people think that credit cards help them manage their money well. They can just pay a little every month, so they can use their money flexible. Nevertheless, they forget that they must pay the high interest if they use the minimum payment. Many people could not afford the interest, so they announce bankrupt. These loans will become bad debts for credit card companies or banks. Too many bad debts could damage not only a company, or a bank but also a country. 

Third, using credit cards increase the risk of disclosing consumers' privacy. With the popular of credit cards, the problems of credit cards fraud have become an important issue nowadays. Although credit cards attempt to reduce these problems by improving their security systems, the credit card fraud still could not be solved completely. Besides, customers' privacy is not assured. Many people attempt to steal customers' information to get some benefit. Also, customers become the victims under the cooperation of companies. For example, companies switch their customers' information to do some commercial activities. 

Therefore, using credit cards might be convenient, but it is certainly not safe. It really has a lot of potential problems we should pay attention to and avoid. Using credit cards has been a tendency, so learning how to use credit cards smartly and carefully should be a big assignment for consumers now.

According to the statistics of Banking Bureau, Financial Supervisory Commission of Taiwan, each Taiwanese who is eligible to apply for credit cards, also called ""plastic cards"", has 5 to 6 credit cards on average until December of 2005 in Taiwan. It is getting convenient and common for people to use credit cards to buy their consumer goods or to pay the bills. Also, the Nison Report, a research on consumer payment system, showed that 40 percent of deals in the United States was paid by credit cards before 2006, and it predicted that 55 percent of deals in the United Sates until 2011 will be paid by credit cards rather than cash. Apparently, these circumstances express that credit cards play an important role in people's lives gradually. Most people believe that credit cards are safe. They do not have to worry about losing cash because they could just have credit cards with them to pay any payments. In fact, however, credit cards are not a safe currency for people. The fact that people rely on credit cards will bring people abundant bad influences and also will hurt the economy of countries. Credit cards will change people's values, raise consumers' debts and increase the risk of disclosing consumers' privacy. First of all, credit cards have changed people's values. In the past, people used cash to pay all of their payments. How much money they spent depended on how much money they had. They had to give up the things they wanted especially luxuries if they did not have enough cash. However, as a result of the popularity of credit cards, people can buy anything even if they can not afford to pay such a price. Take Americans as an example. During Christmas holiday, many stores provide customers with a lot of special discount to stimulate consumption. Many Americans take advantage of the good price to buy a lot of products that they might not need, or gifts that just shows they are generous or rich even they do not have enough money. They can buy any merchandise, which might not be necessary or might be luxuries for them, since they have credit cards. Gradually, this kind of situation distorts people's values. Adults enjoy shopping, entertainment or spending money first; they start to pursue the expensive goods and compare their belongings, such as cars, jewellery, etc., with others. Parents' behaviors would influence children. Afterwards, the young spend money extravagantly in spite of that they do not have good income. The fact that they spend money does not depend on how much money they have, but how much they desire to have the products instead. Besides, the young generation also considers using credit cards as an expression of independence, which means they could do anything by themselves and get rid of their parents. Nevertheless, they forget that using credit cards does not just mean that they become independent, but also they should be responsible for themselves. ""The growing reliance on plastic is also about culture American love freedom. Just as the invention of the mass-produced automobile gave us the freedom to travel wherever or whenever we wished, credit cards allow us to spend money in ways and at the time that work for us. These freedoms, however, make both cars and credit cards dangerous if they are used improperly."" (Gordon & Douglas, 2005, p. 27-29).Second, credit cards will raise consumers' debts. Many people think that credit cards could help people manage their finance well because using installment payments and minimum payments can make them use their money more flexible or efficient. However, they neglect that they need to pay more interest when they adopt installment payments or minimum payments. The amount of these interests is considerable and burdens these people's financial pressure insidiously. In the United States, according to the statistics, in 2004, credit-card debt totaled $685 billion which has risen by about 70 percent. The rising is surprising. Also, the recent statistics shows that credit-card debt has reached $915 billion in the United States. Many banks in the US have a great deal of bad debt, which makes banks' burden increase. Once banks could not afford the bad debt, it will cause a series of economical problems. Economists predicted that the problems of banks' bad debts will bring more serious damage than those of subprime mortgage. Interest is a principal and important source of profit for a credit card company. In Taiwan, the circulating interest rate of credit card debt reaches around 20 percent. Many people could not afford to pay such high interest, which also causes a lot of social problems, such as suicide or public security. These bad debt will result in serious problems which would threaten a country's economy as well. Furthermore, debt threatens a lot of families. Many families are incapable of paying interests; their houses even are mortgaged to banks to pay off their debt. In the US, ""Seventy percentage of American families said last year that they are carrying so much debt that it is making their family loves unhappy; three times more young people are worried about going deeply into debt than about a terrorist attack."" (Gordon & Douglas, 2005, p. 27-29) It is easy to tell that the mortgage problem will be getting worse if people still continue to use credit cards improperly or keep losing self-control on sweeping credit cards. In addition, credit cards are not only a currency, but also a credit history. ""According to the Associated Credit Bureaus, Inc. (2001) there are about 1 billion credit cards in circulation in the United States today. The American market's largest segment, which covers unsecured credit cards, is geared toward consumers with an established credit history."" (Guseva & Rona-Tas, 2001, p. 623-646) More and more people spend too much money by credit cards paying off their payments, so they choose the method of minimum payment. The fact that people use minimum payment not only let people pay more interests but also hurts people's credit histories. A poor credit historywill bring these people bad influence for their finance. For example, they might not able to apply to mortgage successful when they require money to do their business. Last, credit cards will increase the risk of disclosing consumers' privacy. With the popularization of credit cards, credit card companies have abundant of customers' information, such as customers' phone numbers, social security numbers, and so on, so how to protect customers' personal data has become an important issue for credit card companies. As a result of fact, problems of disclosing consumers' privacy have come out seriously. There are several ways to lead to the disclosing of consumers' privacy. First, clerks at the stores sweep your card to get your information from the chip of your credit cards when you check out by credit card. They might sell your information, such as your credit card number, your card verification number and so on, to some illegal organizations to make some profits. In addition, some people take some advantage of their jobs at banks to take the credit card customers' data out. They also might sell the information to the illegal organizations. Even credit card companies would do so. They sell your information to do some commerce. For example, your information might be sold to some insurers. Sometimes, sharing customers' information becomes a strategy under the cooperation between companies. Unfortunately, consumer right might be victimized. ""For those companies, your personal information is actually worth more than the products they're selling."" (Detweiler, 2000, p144) Besides, some hackers use their talents for high technology to get some information through the internet. It is very convenient for people to go shopping online, so more people like shopping online and they use credit cards to check out as well. These computer geniuses could steal the information of the people shopping online from cookies. After gathering these data, they also sell people's data to some organizations. The illegal organizations which attempt to get the data of credit card customers as much as they can make up credit cards according to these information. They use these fake credit cards to get benefits. It is impossible for the users of credit cards to know credit card frauds immediately. Unfortunately, credit-card fraud has become prevalent since credit cards are popular. Many credit card holders usually have no choice but to be charge the loss of credit card fraud. To defeat credit card fraud, many banks also devote to developing the projects to reduce the credit card fraud. For instance, ""HSBC is planning to replace hundreds of fraud detection systems with a single anti-fraud system to monitor bank transactions across 83 operations worldwide. The bank has begun a project in Hong ANON_NAME_0 to adapt credit card fraud detection software to monitor all of its banking products, including credit cards, debit cards, cheques, online and telephone banking and contactless card transactions."" (Flinders, 2007, p1.) Although banks attempt to reduce the credit card fraud and use a lot of security systems and projects to protect their customers from credit card fraud, it is still impossible to guard against fraud and avoid customers' risks completely at present. To conclude, nowadays, a lot of people think credit cards are a convenient and safe tool, or currency. They use credit cards anytime and anywhere in their lives. However, credit cards are a dangerous currency because improper abusing credit cards will bring a great amount of risks and bad influences. First, credit cards will distort people's value. People would buy anything thing they want, even though they do not have money. They will pursue material life and enjoy entertainments. For the young generation, they would learn the value from their parents or their peers. Also, they would abuse credit cards to show they have been adults. They do learn how to use credit card well. Second, credit cards will raise consumers' debts. Many people think that credit cards help them manage their money well. They can just pay a little every month, so they can use their money flexible. Nevertheless, they forget that they must pay the high interest if they use the minimum payment. Many people could not afford the interest, so they announce bankrupt. These loans will become bad debts for credit card companies or banks. Too many bad debts could damage not only a company, or a bank but also a country. Third, using credit cards increase the risk of disclosing consumers' privacy. With the popular of credit cards, the problems of credit cards fraud have become an important issue nowadays. Although credit cards attempt to reduce these problems by improving their security systems, the credit card fraud still could not be solved completely. Besides, customers' privacy is not assured. Many people attempt to steal customers' information to get some benefit. Also, customers become the victims under the cooperation of companies. For example, companies switch their customers' information to do some commercial activities. Therefore, using credit cards might be convenient, but it is certainly not safe. It really has a lot of potential problems we should pay attention to and avoid. Using credit cards has been a tendency, so learning how to use credit cards smartly and carefully should be a big assignment for consumers now.","How many credit cards do you have?

As economy developing, energy demanding grows fast, oil price are becoming higher and higher, and also environmental issue arose. Coal gasification is a kind of clean technology that it can provide many approaches of cleanest conversion of coal into electricity, hydrogen and many other high-valued products. Coal gasification has many benefits such as environmental benefit, efficiency benefit, and coal is also a safe energy source. Thus coal gasification should be encouraged for the benefit of society.
Before discussing the benefits of coal gasification, should we know what kind of technology it is? In simple words, coal gasification is a chemical progress of coal converting to gas, rather than burning coal directly. Technically speaking ""coal gasification (a thermo-chemical process) breaks down coal - or virtually any carbon-based feedstock - into its basic chemical constituents"". In a modern gasifier, coal is typically exposed to hot steam and carefully controlled amounts of air or oxygen under high temperatures and pressures. Under these conditions, carbon molecules in coal break apart, setting off chemical reactions that typically produce a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and other gaseous compounds. Hydrogen from coal gasification is an economical pathway to a sustainable energy future. (Gary J. Stiegel and Massood Ramezan, 2006). 
According to information from the U.S. Department of energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy, coal gasification, in fact, may be one of the best ways to produce clean-burning hydrogen for future's automobiles and power-generating fuel cells. Hydrogen and other coal gases can also be used to fuel power-generating turbines, or as the chemical ""building blocks"" for a wide range of commercial products. The focus is working on coal gasifier advances that enhance efficiency, environmental performance, and reliability as well as expand the gasifier's flexibility to process a variety of coals and other feedstocks (including biomass and municipal/industrial wastes). As commercial-scale application of coal gasification, many experts turn their attention to ""future gasification concepts that offer significant improvements in efficiency, fuel flexibility and economics"".
First of all, coal gasification should be encouraged because it brings environmental benefits. Coal gasification is one of the cleanest approaches of using coal. Some concerns about coal are sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Traditionally, coal is burning directly, which way can brings SOx, NOx and particulate emissions from burning coal-derived gases. However rather than burning coal directly, coal gasification has the advantage to release extremely low SOx, NOx and other particulate emissions. The environmental benefits of gasification are obviously. There are many examples from DOE that can explain how sulfur and nitrogen from coal are captured in the conversion. Sulfur in coal emerges as hydrogen sulfide and can be captured by processes presently used in the chemical industry. In some methods, the sulfur can be extracted in either a liquid or solid form that can be sold commercially. In an Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) plant, the syngas produced is virtually free of fuel-bound nitrogen. NOx from the gas turbine is limited to thermal NOx. Diluting the syngas allows for NOx emissions as low as 15 parts per million. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be used to reach levels comparable to firing with natural gas if required to meet more stringent emission levels. Other advanced emission control processes are being developed that could reduce NOx from hydrogen fired turbines to as low as 2 parts per million. (Source is from DOE website.) Carbon dioxide, which is regarded as greenhouse gases, can also be eliminated effectively as a concentrated gas stream in syngas at high pressure from coal gasification ""if oxygen is used in a coal gasifier instead of air"". In such case, carbon dioxide can be captured and sequestered more easily and at lower costs. By contrast, when coal burns or is reacted in air, 80 percent of which is nitrogen, the resulting carbon dioxide is diluted and more costly to separate. In short, coal gasification can take environmental advantage regarding sulfur, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. 
 Second, coal gasification should be encouraged because it also brings efficiency benefits. A coal gasification power plant is more efficient than a typical coal combustion plant. For example, heat from burning coal in a typical coal combustion plant, is used to boil water, making steam that drives a steam turbine-generator. In some coal combustion plants, only a third of the energy value of coal is actually converted into electricity, the rest is lost as waste heat. However, in a coal gasification power plant typically gets dual duty from the gases it produces. First, the coal gases, cleaned of impurities, are fired in a gas turbine - much like natural gas - to generate one source of electricity. The hot exhaust of the gas turbine is then used to generate steam for use in a more conventional steam turbine-generator. This dual source of electric power, called a ""combined cycle,"" is much more efficient in converting coal's energy into usable electricity. The fuel efficiency of a coal gasification power plant in this type of combined cycle can potentially be boosted to 50 percent or more. (Source is from DOE website.) If adopting a fuel cell or a fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid, will get more than typical coal combustion plants. ""If any of the remaining waste heat can be channeled into process steam or heat, perhaps for nearby factories or district heating plants, the overall fuel use efficiency of future gasification plants could reach 70 to 80 percent."" Higher efficiencies mean more economical benefits. 
 Third, coal gasification should be encouraged because coal is a safe energy source. Coal -based electricity is important to the country which owns coal. ""No other energy source is currently available that can provide a viable, low-cost alternative for electricity production."" Electricity is very difficult to store in significant quantities and so the system depends on generation being to call to meet the demand. Coal is normally stored at power plants and provides an inherent ""buffer"" in case of supply interruption. According to a report from National Academy of Sciences (2002), Committee on science and technology for Countering terrorism to assess the vulnerability of the major U.S. infrastructure systems to terrorist attacks. As a part of the work, the committee conducted an exhaustive analysis of the vulnerability of U.S energy stems, including nuclear power, oil, natural gas, coal, and the electric power system. It found that all aspects of the energy system have various degrees of vulnerability. However, it found that coal was the least vulnerable. 
 Although some people may argue that coal gasification should not be encouraged, because they think that coal is a dirty energy and it cause a lot of environmental problems. Admittedly, coal is a dirty energy, but through technology we can eliminate the disadvantage. Coal gasification is a kind of clean technology and it can be more efficient in dealing with environmental issues such as sulfur, nitrogen oxides, particulate emissions, carbon dioxides and even trace mental. With the developing of coal gasification technology, the capability to produce electricity, hydrogen, chemicals, or various combinations while eliminating nearly all air pollutants and potentially greenhouse gas emissions makes coal gasification one of the most promising technologies for energy plants of the future. 
Some people may argue that biofuels should be encouraged. For example, biofuels are turning ethanol to oil. But ethanol increases global warming, destroys forests and inflates food prices (Michael Grunwald, 2008). Politicians and big business are pushing biofuels like corn-based ethanol as alternatives to oil, All they're really doing is driving up food prices and making global warming worse?and you're paying for it. Other alternative energy approaches also have various problems. 
To conclude, coal gasification is a kind of clean technology that it can provide many approaches of cleanest conversion of coal into electricity, hydrogen and many other high-valued products. Coal gasification has many benefits such as environmental benefit, efficiency benefit, and what the most important is that coal is also a safe energy source. Thus coal gasification should be encouraged for the benefit of society.

As a part of the work, the committee conducted an exhaustive analysis of the vulnerability of U.S energy stems, including nuclear power, oil, natural gas, coal, and the electric power system. It found that all aspects of the energy system have various degrees of vulnerability. However, it found that coal was the least vulnerable. Although some people may argue that coal gasification should not be encouraged, because they think that coal is a dirty energy and it cause a lot of environmental problems. Admittedly, coal is a dirty energy, but through technology we can eliminate the disadvantage. Coal gasification is a kind of clean technology and it can be more efficient in dealing with environmental issues such as sulfur, nitrogen oxides, particulate emissions, carbon dioxides and even trace mental. With the developing of coal gasification technology, the capability to produce electricity, hydrogen, chemicals, or various combinations while eliminating nearly all air pollutants and potentially greenhouse gas emissions makes coal gasification one of the most promising technologies for energy plants of the future. Some people may argue that biofuels should be encouraged. For example, biofuels are turning ethanol to oil. But ethanol increases global warming, destroys forests and inflates food prices (Michael Grunwald, 2008). Politicians and big business are pushing biofuels like corn-based ethanol as alternatives to oil, All they're really doing is driving up food prices and making global warming worse?and you're paying for it. Other alternative energy approaches also have various problems. To conclude, coal gasification is a kind of clean technology that it can provide many approaches of cleanest conversion of coal into electricity, hydrogen and many other high-valued products. Coal gasification has many benefits such as environmental benefit, efficiency benefit, and what the most important is that coal is also a safe energy source. Thus coal gasification should be encouraged for the benefit of society.","Energy, economy and environmental issue are becoming the focus of our society. As economy developing, energy demanding grows fast, oil price are becoming higher and higher, and also environmental issue arose. Coal gasification is a kind of clean technology that it can provide many approaches of cleanest conversion of coal into electricity, hydrogen and many other high-valued products. Coal gasification has many benefits such as environmental benefit, efficiency benefit, and coal is also a safe energy source. Thus coal gasification should be encouraged for the benefit of society. Before discussing the benefits of coal gasification, should we know what kind of technology it is? In simple words, coal gasification is a chemical progress of coal converting to gas, rather than burning coal directly. Technically speaking ""coal gasification (a thermo-chemical process) breaks down coal - or virtually any carbon-based feedstock - into its basic chemical constituents"". In a modern gasifier, coal is typically exposed to hot steam and carefully controlled amounts of air or oxygen under high temperatures and pressures. Under these conditions, carbon molecules in coal break apart, setting off chemical reactions that typically produce a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and other gaseous compounds. Hydrogen from coal gasification is an economical pathway to a sustainable energy future. (Gary J. Stiegel and Massood Ramezan, 2006). According to information from the U.S. Department of energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy, coal gasification, in fact, may be one of the best ways to produce clean-burning hydrogen for future's automobiles and power-generating fuel cells. Hydrogen and other coal gases can also be used to fuel power-generating turbines, or as the chemical ""building blocks"" for a wide range of commercial products. The focus is working on coal gasifier advances that enhance efficiency, environmental performance, and reliability as well as expand the gasifier's flexibility to process a variety of coals and other feedstocks (including biomass and municipal/industrial wastes). As commercial-scale application of coal gasification, many experts turn their attention to ""future gasification concepts that offer significant improvements in efficiency, fuel flexibility and economics"". First of all, coal gasification should be encouraged because it brings environmental benefits. Coal gasification is one of the cleanest approaches of using coal. Some concerns about coal are sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Traditionally, coal is burning directly, which way can brings SOx, NOx and particulate emissions from burning coal-derived gases. However rather than burning coal directly, coal gasification has the advantage to release extremely low SOx, NOx and other particulate emissions. The environmental benefits of gasification are obviously. There are many examples from DOE that can explain how sulfur and nitrogen from coal are captured in the conversion. Sulfur in coal emerges as hydrogen sulfide and can be captured by processes presently used in the chemical industry. In some methods, the sulfur can be extracted in either a liquid or solid form that can be sold commercially. In an Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) plant, the syngas produced is virtually free of fuel-bound nitrogen. NOx from the gas turbine is limited to thermal NOx. Diluting the syngas allows for NOx emissions as low as 15 parts per million. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be used to reach levels comparable to firing with natural gas if required to meet more stringent emission levels. Other advanced emission control processes are being developed that could reduce NOx from hydrogen fired turbines to as low as 2 parts per million. (Source is from DOE website.) Carbon dioxide, which is regarded as greenhouse gases, can also be eliminated effectively as a concentrated gas stream in syngas at high pressure from coal gasification ""if oxygen is used in a coal gasifier instead of air"". In such case, carbon dioxide can be captured and sequestered more easily and at lower costs. By contrast, when coal burns or is reacted in air, 80 percent of which is nitrogen, the resulting carbon dioxide is diluted and more costly to separate. In short, coal gasification can take environmental advantage regarding sulfur, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Second, coal gasification should be encouraged because it also brings efficiency benefits. A coal gasification power plant is more efficient than a typical coal combustion plant. For example, heat from burning coal in a typical coal combustion plant, is used to boil water, making steam that drives a steam turbine-generator. In some coal combustion plants, only a third of the energy value of coal is actually converted into electricity, the rest is lost as waste heat. However, in a coal gasification power plant typically gets dual duty from the gases it produces. First, the coal gases, cleaned of impurities, are fired in a gas turbine - much like natural gas - to generate one source of electricity. The hot exhaust of the gas turbine is then used to generate steam for use in a more conventional steam turbine-generator. This dual source of electric power, called a ""combined cycle,"" is much more efficient in converting coal's energy into usable electricity. The fuel efficiency of a coal gasification power plant in this type of combined cycle can potentially be boosted to 50 percent or more. (Source is from DOE website.) If adopting a fuel cell or a fuel cell-gas turbine hybrid, will get more than typical coal combustion plants. ""If any of the remaining waste heat can be channeled into process steam or heat, perhaps for nearby factories or district heating plants, the overall fuel use efficiency of future gasification plants could reach 70 to 80 percent."" Higher efficiencies mean more economical benefits. Third, coal gasification should be encouraged because coal is a safe energy source. Coal -based electricity is important to the country which owns coal. ""No other energy source is currently available that can provide a viable, low-cost alternative for electricity production."" Electricity is very difficult to store in significant quantities and so the system depends on generation being to call to meet the demand. Coal is normally stored at power plants and provides an inherent ""buffer"" in case of supply interruption.

One of the greatest changes which has influenced on film industries today is the average age of audience. As time goes, youth who include teenagers and children have become main audiences. Hence, TV dramas and films couldn't help being focused on trying to attract teenagers' attention. Because they enjoy something active and always look for something exciting and dynamic, TV dramas and movies have started to use violence as their contents. Violence is so stimulative that TV dramas and movies that contain violence can get teenagers' attention very easily. That is why most of the teenagers are excited by action movies or some kinds of movies that have lots of violent scenes in them. As a matter of fact, then, does violence in TV dramas and movies affect teenagers? The answer is ""Yes."" Steven J. Kirsh once has pointed out the harm of violence in TV dramas and movies to teenagers in his book, ""Children, Adolescents, and Media Violence: A Critical Look at the Research.""(2006) He argues that not only the violence in TV dramas and movies affect teenagers but also the violence in cartoons or sports-all kinds of violence in medias- do. Violence in the media gives teenagers a lot of harmful effects and interrupts their normal growth. The main effects of the violence upon teenagers are three: helping teenagers make wrong their values, making them get real world mixed up with imagination, giving bad influence to their mental health.

 First, violence in TV dramas and movies helps teenagers make wrong their sense of value. Teenagers have an immature thinking faculty and incomplete sense of value. That means that they can be affected by any kind of paradigm or ideology easily. They accept every thoughts and ideas whether it is correct, even ethic or not. For that reason, it is possible enough for teenagers to violate laws, or rules, of the society that they are in, because TV dramas and movies justify all the violence in them. In other words, they make teenagers who watch them believe that using violence for a specific reason that they believe it is reasonable enough-but actually not- could be justice. For example, imagine some well-known movies that describe confrontation between a hero and a villain such as ""Spiderman"" or ""Batman."" In those kinds of movies, a hero always beat his enemies up. He even uses weapons like knives or guns. The teenagers who watch the movie, however, are not scared or surprised at all. On the contrary, they cheer to the hero with clapping their hands. What the hero uses is certainly a cruel violence, but they don't feel even a piece of pity to the opponents. They might have learned that violence is not a good thing and if someone uses it, they must be punished. Therefore, they should blame the hero, who uses violence. Instead, however, they feel happy and exciting. What makes them behave like that? That's because the thoughts, or the idea, in TV dramas and movies is that villains are bad people so that they should be punished in any ways, and a hero is a good person so that he can judge villains. As watching the movies, teenagers feel like they become the hero and beat the opponents. In the real world, sure, they cannot do the behavior but again, their thoughts and sense of value are immature. It means, Steven J. Kirsh says, that they have potential that they can possibly use violence even in the real world whenever they feel uncomfortable. Since usually teenagers think that they are always right and opponents are always wrong, they could feel like they are a hero and their opponents are villains like in a movie, and in lots of cases, they must use violence to ""beat the villains up.""

 Second, violence in the media make teenagers get actuality mixed up with the world of fantasy. In most of the TV dramas and movies, violence is described as a slight thing. In other words, violence in the media is underestimated. For instance, if a hero in a movie stabs his enemies with a knife, or he is stabbed, the teenagers, sure, get happy or anger and feel strong emotions and feelings like they are stabbed. However, they don't feel any pain at all actually. They just experience the emotions and feelings indirectly. They just vaguely imagine that it might be painful, but they don't know how much it hurts, and they cannot understand how serious situation it is. In addition, through the process that they are exposed to the violence in TV dramas and movies continuously, they become insensibility. They believe if they strike someone, the person who is struck might bleed but not hurt, and even if they use dangerous arms, the person who is attacked must not be killed. This thought is unreasonable and very dangerous, but a clear fact is that most of the teenagers believe in this way. However, since the characters in the movie that includes fights of war don't die or even don't hurt easily, or at all, teenagers are likely to accept wrong knowledge, which is that arms and using violence are not serious problems and they can use them depending on the situations.

 The third effect that violence in TV dramas and movies affects upon teenagers is that giving bad influence to their mental health. According to Steven J. Kirsh, teenagers and adolescents are influenced a lot by mass-media, especially TV shows, films, and cartoons. He insists if somebody not only accepts a wrong knowledge or information but also is just exposed to violent environment a lot in their adolescence, it can cause several serious mental problems, or diseases, all throughout their life. For example, according ANON_NAME_0 You, a person who is exposed to violence in TV dramas, movies, computer games, and comic books tends to behave much more aggressively than the person who isn't. He also persists that how many times a person is exposed to a violent situation contributes the levels of people's aggressive degree. The teenagers, namely, who enjoy watching the TV dramas and movies that have many violent factors become more and more aggressive and outrageous. Another problem that can be caused by violence in the media and is related with mental health is that the people, especially adolescents, who are exposed to violence a lot can get serious mental diseases. In general, every color has their own traits and characteristic that people feel with. For example, when someone sees a river or sea, they usually feel cool and refreshing because of the blue color. In winter, many people prefer wearing yellow or brown clothes because those kinds of colors make people feel warm and comfortable. Like these, red has the traits that make people feel uncomfortable, anxious and fearful. In the media that includes violence generally has lots of blood-scenes and there are too much cruelties. They influences upon people's thoughts, especially teenagers, who don't have enough thoughts and considerations, stress them, and make them too nervous to maintain and manage their life.

 Opponents say the violence in TV dramas and movies might not influence upon people or the influence may be very light. They also say that children and teenagers could learn some things from the violence. That means that children and teenagers sometimes can feel confident and get braveness while they are watching violent scenes in TV dramas and movies. Unfortunately, however, it sounds unreasonable. First of all, if children and teenagers are really able to get confident and brave, what makes them be like that? It might be that children and teenagers equate a hero, a winner, with themselves. What about the other way around? What if they equate themselves with a villain, a loser? Could they get confident or brave even in such case? Here is another reason that opponents' persistence does not make sense. Let's suppose their insistence is proven. It might be true. However, even if it is true, what are the confidence and braveness for if children and teenagers get them from violent experiences and if they behave roughly because of the experiences? Also, do they really need to get confident and brave through that way? Aren't there other good or moral ways in order to improve children and teenagers' confidence and braveness? In short, experiencing violence in a TV dramas and movies has harms much more than benefits from it.

 In conclusion, violence in TV dramas and movies influences children and teenagers a lot, and the effects are very serious. Violence in the media can facilitate teenagers make wrong their values, make them get real world mixed up with imagination, weaken their mental health. It is so strong and powerful that teenagers could be often controlled by the experiences. To avoid experiencing the violence, not only children and teenagers but everyone should try not to watch TV dramas and movies, play computer games, and enjoy cartoons all of which include violent scenes. Also, parents have to be able to feel responsible for what their children are watching. Since it is almost impossible to eliminate or limit the dramas and movies that contain violent elements in them, it must be important for every people to keep dealing with that kind of media carefully and protect themselves from the violence.

 The easiest and the most effective way of dealing with garbage is separate garbage collection. We can categorize garbage by matter, such as paper, bottle, plastic and food. If we practice it well, natural products can be produced in different usage. For example, paper is changed into paper bag, notebook, tissue, and soap. Also, rotten food can be natural compost. All things are made of natural materials, so it is not harmful for the body. Shortly, recycling helps us cut back on unnecessary consumption and keep environment safety.

 Beijing officials said more than 80% of sports game stadiums were constructed by 2008. Besides ones related with the Olympic game, there are lots of building under construction in many big cities. Construction leads lots of hazardous dusts, and gas which will definitely ruin air. Secondly, automobile's gas makes air dirty. CO2 and SiO2 are most dangerous gas from automobile. Though many countries have their own regulations, growing number of automobiles can easily beat the nation-wide protect endeavors. Lastly, factory's drawing off noxious gas makes atmosphere destroyed. This is magnified in fast-growing country like china because of lack of related regulations.

It doesn't only depend on personal endeavors but require nation-wide cooperation. Related law should be made for each country or big city and it should lead to change people's mind.

As society become more industrial, it has made the Earth a more convenient place for human habitation. However, a lot of animals are confronted with human activities. There are several ways to protect endangered animals: protecting the environment, and protecting the endangered animal.

First of all, protecting the environment. This is largely because there are some animals that were endangered by environment pollution. In other words, if some animals' habitats would be disturbed by human being's activities such as developing too much industrialization and spending too much fossil energy resources. For example, people have been cutting down a great amount of trees for industrialization. In this respect, human activities have changed living habitats into desert and barren land.

Furthermore, human activities are threatening a lot of animal's lives. This is largely because many people now want to get animals' leather such as a bear fur, a fox fur, and an elephant tusk for their ornamentation. Therefore, many animals were deprived of their lives by human's greed. However, through this human being's activities, ecosystem and food chain are broken and even human lives are threatening.

When I came to the United States for the first time alone 2 years ago, I had a not so interesting experience. I flew from Taiwan to Japan, then from Japan to the USA. I arrived in the Detroit airport. I was very excited to be in the US, but something went wrong! A customs official did not let me pass the gate, but told me to go to a waiting room for questions. I thought I was in trouble and could not enter the US!

The customs official first asked many times why I had two very large and heavy bags and many things in them. I told him I really needed so many things. Some things were also pricey so he asked me if I was selling those things to make a lot of money. He also found $1700 US cash on me. It was given to me by my father before I came to the US. I only wrote down $700 because I didn't know my father gave me so much money. The customs official thought I was lying and I was going to use the money to do bad things in the US. During this time I was so nervous and I even cried because he was giving me a hard time. My English was also very poor, so he confused me with his questions many times. Finally, after almost 1.5 hours he believed me and let me go, but I missed my Pittsburgh flight. This was such a bad experience for me, but I am glad I am studying in the US now.","When I came to the United States for the first time alone 2 years ago, I had a not so interesting experience.

 When I was in six, I was on my way to the market with five dollars that were given by my mother. First, I had the money in my fist not to lose it. Then, I put the money in my pocket because I thought that it was safer. At that moment, a boy approached me and whispered in my ear. 
""Hey, can you see that man? He is a very bad person, and he will get all of your money!"" 
He told me that he could hide my money, and then he put his hand in my side pocket and grabbed something there and put his hand in my pocket on back of my pants. I thought that he moved my money from my side pocket to the back pocket. After that, he ran away and joined with the bad man, and they ran together. I stood there silently for minutes because it had happened too quickly for a little boy and it had been related to the bad man which had been a fearful subject for me. After a few minutes, I checked my back pocket, but money was not there. I came back home crying, and I cannot forget that moment. 
 This experience always reminds me 'the relative value of money'. To me in the present, five dollars is just some money that can be used for lunch or coffee. However, to the young boy in the past, five dollars was such a huge amount of money. Surely, the worth of money is being changed, but that is not all. I was just a little kid, and the economical situation of my family was not good at that time. For these reasons, the value of five dollars to the kid was same as that of a hundred dollars to me now. Whenever I remember the memory, I always talk to my mother how worth the money was to me.
 There is nothing better than memories. In my case, I have precious memory about money, and it makes me remember the little kid in the past and feel growing.

English will still be used very universally in the next 10 years, but I believe another language that will become more and more important on the World Wide Web over the next 10 years is Chinese.

It is very obvious that more and more people are investing in China. Many companies are opening factories in China because it is cheaper to make everything there. Almost all companies have websites in English right now, but more and more of the websites also have Chinese versions. Also, the population of China is increasing everyday, so actually 1/4 of all the people in the world now speak Chinese. If this keeps going, most people will be able to speak Chinese in the next 10 years. This will be very interesting for me because I will be one of the people who can speak both Chinese and English in the world.

Y,K1710,18589,ha0,Korean,Male,394,5,r,2543,1,288,284,284,"I think that Korean government should encourage uniformity of language in Korea. There are several reasons why we have to keep Korean language: Valuing history and excellence of Korean and protecting our own culture. 
 Koreans have their own language, Han-gul. In the world, it is very difficult to find the language which survived for more than 10 decades, but Han-gul was made more than 1,000 years ago. Also, Han-gul is praised by many famous linguists for its excellence. Han-gul is precise and fine language, and it is so easy to learn Han-gul that the illiteracy rate in Korea is extremely low. Furthermore, using our own language can be a good way to protect our culture. Usually, young people try to pursue new things that come from out of their country. After they spend their 20s going after things from other countries, they start to look at their things that they had since they were born and compare things they have to things from outside. Finally, they will realize that the excellence and the preciousness of their own language and culture.
 What could happen if Korean government decided to accept other language as an official language? First of all, there would be a chaotic period because Koreans consisted of single ethnicity and language for a long time. Also, Koreans have lots of cultures and long history from ancestors who used Han-gul, so new people who use other language would not accept these cultures and history as theirs. As a result, the unique characteristics of Koreans could be faded or disappeared. 
 For these merits of keeping Korean only and demerits of allowing using other language, I strongly recommend to hold the uniformity of language in Korea.

 As far as all of us know, English has become a universal language in the globalized world.

Some people say that English is just a useful means to communicate with the others. As the world become global, the need for the language to talk between people who speak other languages has raised. Now, English plays the role as a main language in several international fields. However, I don't think that English is a neutral means for second-language speaker because a language has tacit and intangible traits. Therefore, English is not only related with American culture but also can eliminate other languages. 

From my point of view, to speak English in all international relations can cause cultural imperialism. A language is associated with her country's history and culture. It also affects thought system and people's spirit. For this reason, a language is very important and people should try to keep and protect their language. In addition, cultural imperialism is very subtle and intangible as shown in the article, ""Can English be dethroned?"", and then it is easy to dominate by English without knowing that. What is more, other languages are affected by English and can be easily changeable. For example, if children start to learn English at the early time, they can be poor at their mother tongue. The possibility is too high that the children who can speak English fluently may transform and pollute their language according as English usages. If this trend continues, they may lose their peculiar traits in the language, and what is worse, they may lose their language. In short, I think that English is not a neutral means for second-language speaker.

Second, schools in foreign countries are teaching English because students have to learn and enhance a second language to start a college. Finally, third you have to learn English to access a websites, read emails, etc because now everything is in English.

However, the English language is called ""commercial language"", it poses serious threatens because every time there are fewer and fewer Native American speakers (English speakers) against the growing number of Hispano-Americans (Spanish speakers) and in different areas of knowledge have been created different dialects of English, as well as you have to learn a dialect to the corresponding area of knowledge that you are interesting. In other way, right now a lot of American people want to learn Spanish language because it is the second language for them.

There are some similarities and differences between the previous me and present me, such as ambition, independently and attitude.
 First, I have some characters that have never changed between the two periods. No matter in China or in United States, I always have ambition. I believe that talent is not born by accident. The appropriate environment, the right education can make a person become talented and confident. Another thing that I have never changed is that I am always optimistic. In my opinion, if I work hard, I can overcome any difficulties. I think my life is filled with opportunities and hope.
 Second, there are some changes happened to me during my new life in the United States. Compared with similarities, there are more differences. First of all, after the one month, I have learned more about independently. In China, everything depends on my parents. Even just housework is done by my mother. Now, I do everything by myself. Secondly, I have eaten my mum's cooking for more than ten years, so I was bored with that. On the contrary, I miss the flavor of my mum's cooking so much now. In addition, in the past, I was always impatient to talk with my mother. Sometimes, maybe it made her upset. But now, I have become sensible and mature. When I was talking to my mum, she said I was growing up and she was very proud of me. Lastly, I used to be very lazy, and never did exercises. Now, I go to the gym everyday when my classes are over. I do this in order to form a better life habits that can make me healthier, so my parents needn't worry about me.
 To conclude, there are some similarities and differences between the previous me and present me. The positive things in my mind have never changed, but I have abandoned some shortcomings during the first month. In the future, I will become better and achieve my goal.

There are some similarities and differences between the previous me and present me, such as ambition, independently and attitude. First, I have some characters that have never changed between the two periods. No matter in China or in United States, I always have ambition. I believe that talent is not born by accident. The appropriate environment, the right education can make a person become talented and confident. Another thing that I have never changed is that I am always optimistic. In my opinion, if I work hard, I can overcome any difficulties. I think my life is filled with opportunities and hope. Second, there are some changes happened to me during my new life in the United States. Compared with similarities, there are more differences. First of all, after the one month, I have learned more about independently. In China, everything depends on my parents. Even just housework is done by my mother. Now, I do everything by myself. Secondly, I have eaten my mum's cooking for more than ten years, so I was bored with that. On the contrary, I miss the flavor of my mum's cooking so much now. In addition, in the past, I was always impatient to talk with my mother. Sometimes, maybe it made her upset. But now, I have become sensible and mature. When I was talking to my mum, she said I was growing up and she was very proud of me. Lastly, I used to be very lazy, and never did exercises. Now, I go to the gym everyday when my classes are over. I do this in order to form a better life habits that can make me healthier, so my parents needn't worry about me. To conclude, there are some similarities and differences between the previous me and present me. The positive things in my mind have never changed, but I have abandoned some shortcomings during the first month. In the future, I will become better and achieve my goal.",3,

Externally, universities in the world would have similar systems. However, a comparison of universities in Taiwan and the USA show couple of similarities and some differences.
First of all, the most important thing is education and study. Universities always study to make creative and practical things. In America, many companies support financial help to universities, and universities give good ideas to companies. For example, in Silicon Valley. In Taiwan, many companies assist university's research institute.
On the other hand, it is very difficult to enter university in Taiwan, so high school students have to study very hard. However, if they pass an entrance exam, it is easy to graduate from a university. However, in America, it is very easy to enter university in general, but it is difficult to graduate from a university. In Taiwan, professor give generous grades to students, so students pointed out that these grades were meaningless. However, in America, professors evaluate student's abilities absolutely. 
In conclusion, in Taiwan , we should be a little more open-minded to take opening mind, and in America, it's better to think and say freely, but it's necessary to act courteously. We know that we have some problems about education, so we try to keep up with distinguished universities in the world and research good educational system. When we feel we have problems, we deal with them flexibly. That's a strong point.

Last August, I arrived to the USA from my country Chile; my first impression was amazing because all things were so new for me here, specially the language. I was worried about the language because this is my first time in a country where all the people speak English. Also to my surprise that wasn't the biggest complication. The worst started when I ate my first meal in the United States. They are so subtle similarities and differences at the same time relative to food and eating habits between Chile and the USA.
In essence the similarities were the ingredients. We have the same ingredients for everything: the same vegetables, the same fruits, and the meats are the same, too. For example beef, chicken, pork, turkey, fish, etc. The basic group of ingredients is the same, which made me very happy. Then when I checked the menu for me was splendid because the names of dishes are the same, too. Some names just changed a little for the translations. But the main idea was the same; for example, the salad was prepared with the same vegetables and the barbeque with the same meats. All was perfect for me until I ordered my dish. There started the differences.
However the preparation was completely different between both countries. They have different ways of cooking. In Chile, we are used to baking many of our dishes, and in the USA almost all the dishes are fried. Actually my biggest surprise was when the waitress gave me my salad, and I saw the french fries inside. That was so strange, because I never saw that before; it was strange but delicious. After that, the waitress gave me a bowl full with dressing for my salad, many kinds of dressings with different flavors, for all kinds of taste. We just use lemon juice, salt and a few drops of olive oil for dressing the vegetables. That experience was delicious because that day I tried more than four different dressing for my salad. Another difference was the kind of food that composes each meal: for example the bacon, in the USA is so common see bacon in almost all dishes like pastas, sandwiches, salads, another. For me is really complicated and disgusting eat bacon with fried eggs for my breakfast, that is too much heavy for my stomach. I would prefer a cup of milk with fruit or maybe a slice of bread with butter.
Finally, in my opinion, we have similarities and differences about food and eating habits between both countries. Rather that the different are best part because I can experiment with new flavors and new dishes with the same ingredients. The most important thing is that I can learn a lot about the customs, traditions and culture in the USA, my new home for a couple of years.

Another aspects, is that in my country we are used to eating healthy food, it is different than here because you can fin good prices in restaurant for healthy food .In the USA if you want to eat healthy food , it is a little expensive and sometimes the people here prefer to eat fast food because its cheaper but not healthy.


 When it comes to the similarities, because of the large latin population in America we can find a lot of the original latin dishes in restaurants around the united states. We might feel some differences when it comes to the taste but overall its close enough to feel like home. 


 In Conclusion, I think eating habits is very important and more in this year , a lot of people have overweight and everything is because the fast food is an easy way fast but is not good for our body.

Y,K2147,21085,as7,Korean,Female,426,4,w,2808,1,480,471,471,"These days, I'm studying English in the ELI Program. It starts at 10 o'clock and ends at 4 o'clock, and after school, I have some homework from each class. So as you can imagine, my weekdays usually run by pretty fast. In contrast, there is plenty of time on the weekends, but I don't have any idea how to spend this free time. I want to do something special which I've wanted to do for years, and I thought about taking pictures and painting. However, I couldn't make a decision right away because both of them seem like a lot of fun. It was only after I analyzed the similarities and differences between the two activities, that I finally came to my decision to take pictures.

 At first, it seems that taking pictures and painting have a lot in common. First of all, through both activities, I can see the same places as a photo or a painting no matter where I've picked. I can take a picture at the top of the mountain but also draw a picture at the same place. In addition, after doing both activities, I can keep the photos or paintings as a record, and both of them will help to remind me of that moment. Lastly, pieces of art such as photos and paintings can be shared with others or given to other people as presents. I think this is the most exciting part.

 In addition, it was when I looked at the differences between the two activities that I made my final decision. In terms of touching up, a painting can be changed or fixed easier than a photo. Of course, I can adjust a photo by using a computer program but I can't change it while I'm taking it. Besides, a painting can be colored whatever I choose, but a photo comes with exact same colors of the real things. As a result, not only the colors but also all of the subjects are showed more precisely in the photos. However, I realized that these should not be the most important factors in my decision. The most important thing is time. If I paint something, it would take more time than taking one photo. Especially in the case of a Polaroid camera, a photo comes in a second and shows the scene in a minute. That's a big difference. 

 In conclusion, after taking these factors into consideration, now I know what I'm going to do. Since accuracy, convenience and memories are important, I think I can have much more fun taking pictures. Besides, I think taking pictures makes me more outgoing and social person because if I want to take some pictures, it makes me go to many beautiful places. It will be really good for both of my mental and physical health.","These days, I'm studying English in the ELI Program.

Especially in the case of a Polaroid camera, a photo comes in a second and shows the scene in a minute. That's a big difference. In conclusion, after taking these factors into consideration, now I know what I'm going to do. Since accuracy, convenience and memories are important, I think I can have much more fun taking pictures. Besides, I think taking pictures makes me more outgoing and social person because if I want to take some pictures, it makes me go to many beautiful places. It will be really good for both of my mental and physical health.","These days, I'm studying English in the ELI Program. It starts at 10 o'clock and ends at 4 o'clock, and after school, I have some homework from each class. So as you can imagine, my weekdays usually run by pretty fast. In contrast, there is plenty of time on the weekends, but I don't have any idea how to spend this free time. I want to do something special which I've wanted to do for years, and I thought about taking pictures and painting. However, I couldn't make a decision right away because both of them seem like a lot of fun. It was only after I analyzed the similarities and differences between the two activities, that I finally came to my decision to take pictures. At first, it seems that taking pictures and painting have a lot in common. First of all, through both activities, I can see the same places as a photo or a painting no matter where I've picked. I can take a picture at the top of the mountain but also draw a picture at the same place. In addition, after doing both activities, I can keep the photos or paintings as a record, and both of them will help to remind me of that moment. Lastly, pieces of art such as photos and paintings can be shared with others or given to other people as presents. I think this is the most exciting part. In addition, it was when I looked at the differences between the two activities that I made my final decision. In terms of touching up, a painting can be changed or fixed easier than a photo. Of course, I can adjust a photo by using a computer program but I can't change it while I'm taking it. Besides, a painting can be colored whatever I choose, but a photo comes with exact same colors of the real things. As a result, not only the colors but also all of the subjects are showed more precisely in the photos. However, I realized that these should not be the most important factors in my decision.

Also in Prewriting the writer can use a Map where their ideas are connected with circles and lines. The second step is writing, in this step the writer starts to write the paragraphs, beginning with a topic sentence that states the main idea, then including several sentences that support the main idea but the writer doesn't have to include information that doesn't directly support the main idea. Finally the writer has to use words to help the reader understand how the ideas in their paragraph are connected. The third and last step is revising, it is most important because in this step the writer checks the mistakes that it has.

Before you think about stress reduction, it may be most useful to start by identifying the particular stressors in your work. Specifically, is it about your work situation that makes you feel anxious, angry, frustrated, depressed, and so on? Then you can think about how to solve them at a time. Managing stress is a process, like eating a pie and White (2008) states that are using flowers in strategic locations to help energize and improve your mood ( White, Julia Bodeeb. Use Flowers to Decrease Stress & Improve Health. 9 Oct. 2008). Stress have commonly situations like difficulty sleeping, muscle tension, headaches, and many others symptoms. Job-related stress often stems from deadline pressures and relationship with colleagues. Social support from family, friends, and colleagues is another way to work out stress-induced emotions. However, no matter what the causes of your tension here are several tips for managing stress in your work environment:
The first solution, try asking your friends for stress management resources. Sometimes your friends can give you some suggestions and resources to help you reducing your stress.
Another solution, discuss your workload with your supervisor. Sometimes your supervisor will adjust your workload or give you an assistant to help you.
The best solution, try involving your best friend who has generated positive options for thinking and behaving differently in your work environment. 
Foremost, it is almost always more beneficial to change your own actions, rather than trying to change others who we think the causes of our stress. Although it may seem difficult to ask for help, stress is quite common. In fact, many of your colleagues may share some similar stressors and may be able to provide support. It is better to speak out workplace woes, and other sources of stress, sooner rather than later.

Since child had been a sport girl, I really love the sport and enjoy a lot practicing. I running every morning for 45 minutes don't matter if it's raining or a sun day, I run. These 45 minutes in the morning is the only ways who I have to throw away my stress, when I was running I forgot all the worries of the office, the meetings with the costumers, and all my work obligations. Run is my escape's door to everything about the office and forget my stress. Other persons preferred more relaxing activities or hobbies like Yoga, Pilates or swim is these work for them is perfect. I'm a really energy persons for that I need an energy activity. In conclusion when existed a problem with so many meanings as the stress, don't exist a only way to combat them, is necessary found the way who work for you may be working just in the week, taking break or practicing any hobby are the most common ways to fighting with stress of work or school. In my personal case practice a sport is the best way because running is the only one who makes me forget all my responsibilities and preoccupation about the work. I found the escape's door of stress but you find your door?","In nowadays everybody speaks about stress, who is one of the most popular illness in this days, everything because ours new style of life. All fast and quickly; stress at work or stress at school are the most commons, the consequents of have stress, the problem with the families about this, the all possible solutions and treatment but nobody knows really what stress means even the specialist in this topic, ""Stress is difficult for scientists to define because it is a subjective sensation associated with varied symptoms that differ for each of us. In addition, stress is not always a synonym for distress. Situations like a steep roller coaster ride that cause fear and anxiety for some can prove highly pleasurable for others. Winning a race or election may be more stressful than losing but this is good stress""1 For that is so complicated found an only solution for a problem with a name so shortly but who affected a thousand of people around the world. For that I think that the only way to combat this illness is trying to forget founding an escape door. Working just in the week, taking breaks and practicing some activity are ways to help our body to combat this terrible sickness. Organized our tasks for work just in the week can be sounds easy but is really hart, a good organized and planification of all the activities at work is the dreamer of all people, who have a complicated work with a lot of activities, meetings, presentations with costumers. Some person can organized so perfectly this schedules and finished this work in week. In my case that never works, all the time I brought work to house to finish some report or one presentation for the next days. I really try to finish the things in the office but the time if over and continuo working at home all time. Don't try to left things for weekends are impossible to me. I have so many report to do and information to analyze. The weekends for me are just one day more that I have to work. Other option for the stress is take a break once a month or maybe each tree month take a mini vacations a long weekend to rest. That sound perfect for me but I don't have the time necessary to be absent for one week of my work or even for a couple of days. The responsibility is so much important and I'm worry all time about so many things who try to take a break in medley of an important meeting who is soon is impossible to me. I'm completely workaholic; I can't stop to thinking in my work. Maybe a better option in my case is once a month do something different to break the routine, perhaps that can be result in my case stop to work just a couple of hours and do something completely different.

Heart disease has already become a leading threat to the health of the people in the world. The heart is a complex organ that is vulnerable to hereditary as well as environment risks. According to these risk factors, cardiologists divide the causes of heart disease into two categories: major causes of heart disease and minor causes of heart disease. The following introduction is talking about these causes.
 There are five major causes of the heart disease. One of the five is Family History. If you parents or grandparents have had heart disease, as a result of you being at a higher risk for developing it. The Second is High Blood Pressure. It can cause the heart to work too hard and damage arteries. The third is High Cholesterol Levels. It is dangerous because fatty deposits build up in blood vessels. The fourth is Diabetes. Consequently, diabetes can lead to hardening of the arteries and heart attacks. The fifth is Smoking Cigarettes. Smokers are two or three times more likely to have a heart attack than nonsmokers.
 Except the five major causes, cardiologists also point out three minor causes of heart diseases. The first is Type A Personality. The research is found that the person who has this type is easy to because stressed, being overly competitive, aggressive, and intense. The second is Having a Sedentary lifestyle. Often, these people don't get enough exercise. The third is Obesity. Usually, the obesity people are extremely overweight, and due to have a poor diet. The three minor causes are latent danger to cause heart disease.
 Either the major or the minor causes that people have had, they should already be under the doctor's care. The doctors can treat, control or modify the risk of heart diseases. It is never too late or too early to begin improving heart health.

For others, disloyal spouse is the main lead to a separate family. No matter what the reason is, divorce can bring many effects to the couple's life, especially bad effects to the whole family. Personal life and children's life can be largely related because of a divorce.

 A separate family can also largely affect the couple's personal life, especially the one feel been dumped. Many divorced people have lower self-confidence than people who have regular family life. For example, they need to live alone, which brings more loneness to them. They may upset their parents no matter what the divorce reason was. In some case, they will lose some friends due to the sensitiveness of the personal. In other case, divorced people often have financial problem if they don't have a higher paid job. It's always easier to support a family by two instead of one.

Not only is personal life changing a consequence of divorce, but also children's life can be greatly affected. As the Chinese saying goes, ""children are the future."" Even though some children study harder and become a strong person, they would be better off in a whole and regular family. A broken family will not bring a warm and secure home to a child. A child who has a separate family often feels bad and that often lead to a future problem. For example, my cousin had a classmate whose parents were divorced when he was little. The classmate became a trouble maker and finally dropped out from elementary school. 

In summary, divorce is a big aspect of people's life. For themselves, they have to deal with the all trouble and all 'side-effect' of a separate family. For their children, they have to tolerate the pain of living with only one of the parents. Due to the harm of a divorce case, I believe many people need to learn to be more responsible and loyal in order to have a whole family.

If we did that process, we would stay up all night for many days. Therefore, I want to focus on the effects of a social and an economic problem. A social and an economic problem have had several important effects on my country.

 First, I there are three effects of a social problem. For example, people started to build more hospice hospitals, buildings for seniors or the retired. Next, we could say that one of the major effects of the social problem is increased crime rate. The crime came from not a severe action like murder, but an essential desire to eat like a grocery store thief. Third, the effect is decreasing the number of children. Because many women have more chances to work and become more independent, they have thought living alone is better than a marriage. That is why the birth rates are too low.

 On the next stage, there are also three aspects of an economic problem. First of all, the most serious problem in economic is a growing unemployment rate. Due to the global depression, many workers are laid off from their work place. In addition, it is too difficult for many young students to get a job. Second, many small companies and some of global corporations are bankrupted. For example, many construction companies were already bankrupted and merged by other corporations. Third, as a fundamental problem, whereas the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer. The world is not just for rich people, but for everyone.

 In conclusion, we got to know that there are many effects of a social and an economic problem in my country. However, there are no countries in the world without a social and an economic problem. I think the most important thing is realizing what we have to do. It is a problem not of person but of everyone. We have to go through and overcome these problems.

Nostalgiain many ways, is associated with the memory of the city in which we grew up. Whenever we take great delight in retrieving the most interesting part of our hometown, we are, de facto, suffering from nostalgia and unconsciously comparing different cities. The underlying causes of distinguishing characters between two cities may stem from various perspectives- culture, architectural style and the everyday life. In the light of this statement, Shanghai, the city in which I have lived for a long time, shares something in common with and also significantly differs from Pittsburgh.
The most visual and direct impact that I have experienced when I arrived in Pittsburgh, after a 14-hour-flight from Shanghai, is the city's various architectural styles. It is by no means to say that Shanghai lacks in modern structures-there are too many of them. Shinning glasses of high-rise widows in the sun, glinting light shed from tall buildings at night, twisting iron structures emerging on streets are common scenes in this giant city. However, once I traveled from one end to the far end of Shanghai, crossing the concrete forest, I suddenly noticed that the monotonous rhythm of the architectural style almost lulled me to sleep. But traveling in Pittsburgh always brings me unexpected, hilarious experiences. Gothic, Baroque, Classic French styles can be found in different regions. Even the Cathedral of Learning, the building in which we study every day, has its reputation and is regarded as a national landmark. Aside from those conspicuous buildings, it is a jaw-dropping fact that, when I ride my bicycle in Squirrel Hill for an hour, I cannot find any two houses that look the same. Not to mention the beauty of gardens in spring, the adorable small animals-jumping rabbits in backyards and hidden squirrels in trees. Definitely, Pittsburgh deserves its fame of the most livable city of the U.S.
Shanghai and Pittsburgh share something in common from a cultural aspect. Both cities have several amazing museums in which multicultural art work is exhibited. The creative imagination that descents from one of Von Gogh's painting, which is preserved in Carnegie Museum, may slightly differ from his other work exhibited in the History Museum of Shanghai. You can also find famous ancient Chinese artists' work in Pittsburgh's museums. Theatres, on the other hand, always have wonderful performances in both cities. My recent experience of listening to Lang Lang's concert is a good example to show the cultural similarity between Shanghai and Pittsburgh. Just one year ago, I listened to his performance in Shanghai, sitting 10 yards away from him. The young pianist played his favorite SCHUBERT's and CHOPIN's sonata 12 months later in Pittsburgh. In this case, the only difference for me is-I was sitting 20 yards away from him this time.
However, life in the two cities makes them different from each other. Based on the assumption that everyone owns a car, shopping in Pittsburgh is not as easy as in Shanghai. For instance, when I told my mother that my wife has spent more than 3 hours on the road for her shopping in Grove City-the place which is familiar to Pittsburgh's inhabitants, my mother was confused because there are two huge shopping malls just a 10-minute-walk from our home in Shanghai. Services in Shanghai, from restaurants to sports club, are always available. It is even not difficult to find a restaurant at mid-night; imagine how comfortable you will feel when you are enjoying a bowl of sea-food soup after having worked in front of your computer for a long time. The dishes, of course, can be delivered in 10 minutes if you want them to be delivered to your place. In addition, French and Italian restaurants and other countries' cuisine are distributed around the cities as well. There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best. However, Japanese, Korean, Chinese students often lodge complain about the Japanese, Korean and Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. Those restaurants, to satiate Americans' taste, change a lot and seldom provide authentic cuisine. Compared with that of Shanghai, the choice in a Pittsburgh's café is usually frustrating and poor.
In sum, Shanghai and Pittsburgh share cultural similarity in cultural whereas there are distinct characters in their architectural styles and life. If I have to choose a city to live in, I prefer Shanghai to Pittsburgh. Is it nostalgia?

Like this, sometimes people have to make the better choice between similar things. For example, I decided to come here, Pittsburgh, to learn English. This choice was very important and not easy. Thus, I tried to compare the University of Pittsburgh with another school, the University of California, Los Angeles. To be specific, I examined two schools having the ELI(or ESL) course by three references; quality, price, and living environment. 
 The first consideration was the weather, because I have to live for one year and I like cool weather better than hot or cold. Thus I just wanted to select the city which does not have long summers or which has a low average temperature. Of the two cities, Los Angeles was cooler city than Pittsburgh in summer according to the climate information from the Internet. Furthermore, Los Angeles was warmer than Pittsburgh in winter. Therefore, I preferred to go to Loa Angeles to live in for one year.
 The second consideration was the quality of education about English. I selected two language schools; University of California, Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh. However, I could not know which course had higher quality, because they had similar curriculum, 20 hours per week, 12~16 weeks per semester, activities, and trips. According to the information from their web site, these schools emphasized that they provided a high quality of education and had good reputation. Thus, I asked my acquaintances and friends for advice. A person who already had studied the ELI in University of Pittsburgh recommended that University of Pittsburgh could be a better selection between the two schools. The first reason was that this school had a long history in Linguistics studies. The second reason was that this course's reputation ranked the fifth in the U.S. 
 The third consideration was the expense during one year. Actually, this factor was the most important, because I didn't want to spend much money. This really helped to make a decision, because there was a big difference. The total amount of expenditure in Los Angeles was higher than Pittsburgh; in Los Angeles I would have needed approximately double the expense in Pittsburgh. In the tuition aspect Pittsburgh is a little more expensive, but in living expense Los Angeles was much more expensive. Therefore, I could not but choose University of Pittsburgh. As a result, this last consideration was the most important thing as to decision where to go. 
 To sum up, when I decided on attending ESL, I considered two schools, University of California, Los Angeles and University of Pittsburgh, and three aspects such as weather, quality of education, and expense. After concerning all features prudently, I chose this school, University of Pittsburgh. Of the three conditions, the most important factor of this decision was the expense during one year.","When you come to the fork of a road, you may think again and again which is better way to get your destination.

 Which types of restaurants do you like? Some people like eastern restaurants, others western restaurants. In my family's case, we like both of them. However, especially, my husband and my son have a tendency to prefer to western restaurants such as 'Outback', or 'TGIF', than eastern restaurants such as 'Korean garden', or 'Oishi'. On the contrary, I have a tendency to prefer to eastern restaurants than western restaurants. There are some similarities and differences between eastern restaurants and western restaurants. 
 First, I want to write about food. Both are a lot of delicious and various foods such as meat dishes, fish dishes, and plates of vegetables. Do you like meat dishes, or a plate of vegetables? In my case, if I want to eat a meat dish, I will go to a western restaurant, where the meat melts in my mouth. Besides, there are lots of delicious meat dishes such as barbeque rib, or New York strips. On the contrary, if I want to eat a plate of vegetables, I will go to an eastern restaurant. There are lots of excellent vegetable dishes, for example, boiled rice with assorted mixtures (Bibim bab), or rice rolled in dried layer with vegetables (kim bab). In addition, if you go there, you can see new food and experience new taste you did not see and taste as like, gal-bi, bul-go-gi, or soy bean soup. And other difference is the western foods are saltier and sweeter than the eastern foods. 
 Second, there are similarities and differences with eastern and western restaurants in the environment aspect. Both of them are clean, they have their unique features, and the employees are kind. However, the differences are to order and have a seat, to communicate, and convenient facilities. First, I have to order before I have a seat in the eastern restaurants, but I have a seat and I order in the western restaurants. Next, to communicate is different. In the eastern restaurant, I feel more comfortable, because it is possible to speak Korean. In addition, I can joke with the owner. I cannot imagine that at other restaurants. However, in the western restaurant, I have to practice how to pronounce the name of food before ordering. How silly it is! Last, the difference is the convenient facilities such as restroom, and the size of restaurants. The western restaurants are more convenient at using restroom, and the space is bigger than the eastern restaurants'. 
 Last, the tipping culture is distinguished. You do not have to pay a tip at the eastern restaurants. Whether you pay the tip or not, it is entirely up to you. However, you have to pay a tip about 15~ 20 % of your dish at the western restaurants. I went there the first time, I did not feel well, and I did not tip the waiter. By that time I am not good at giving 
a tip. When I was in my country, South Korea, tipping culture is not popular. Giving a tip is completely up to you. However, it is expected in the US and Western countries. 
 In conclusion, both of them are a lot of tasty and various foods, and they have good environments. However, there are also differences such as restroom, inner size, taste, communication, and a tip. Nevertheless, I hope you can enjoy both of them.

I grew up in a big city called Bogota, which is the capital of Colombia, a country located in South America. I changed my permanent residency seven months ago when my husband and I decided to come to Pittsburgh and spend one year. My new life in Pittsburgh has brought me many positive experiences and friends, and also during this time I have missed some good aspects from my hometown. It does not matter how much time I spent in Bogota and Pittsburgh, these cities have played an important role in my life because in both I feel like home. This is the reason why I consider that these cities are similar in many ways, but I also think that these cities are very different, which makes them unique and irreplaceable in some aspects such as weather and transportation. 
Bogota and Pittsburgh have many similarities. The first similarity is that these cities are the place where my best friends live, with whom I have shared many important events. For example, in Bogota I have my school and university friends, with whom I spent my adolescence, my first job experience, and my first years of marriage. In Pittsburgh I got three good friends, one from my country and the other two from Chile and Saudi Arabia, who have helped me to face the challenges in my new life here, and cheered me up when I needed it. Also another similarity is the spots where I can have fun. Pittsburgh and Bogota have a mountain where you can get a better view of the city, a wide range of restaurants to have a good time, and lovely cinemas to go and watch movies. Pittsburgh has places such as Waterfront or South side, and Bogota has places called T-zone, G-zone, Unicentro Mall and Santafe Mall. 
Despite of the fact that Bogota and Pittsburgh have similarities, also these cities are different in some aspects. The first aspect is the weather. While Bogota has a cold weather most of the time, Pittsburgh has four seasons that last three months each one with different conditions. These climate conditions determine the clothes that people have to wear. When I am in Bogota, I should wear warm clothes such as sweater or jacket to protect myself from the cold. In Pittsburgh, I have to change my clothes depending on the season, ranging from summer clothes for the hot weather, such as short pants and swimsuit, to warmer clothes for the winter like coats, gloves and scarf. Changing clothes according with the season means that some articles of clothing that I used in the past season are not fancy anymore in the following year. In Bogota, this does not happen because all the clothes I have are useful all the time. 
 The second difference between Bogota and Pittsburgh is transportation. While Pittsburgh has an organized traffic system, which everybody respects and obeys, Bogota has disorganized traffic, as a consequence of a bad behavior of people who think they can violate the rules. Also, Pittsburgh has another positive point over Bogota: Pittsburgh has a subway and Bogota does not. However, Bogota has an advantage over Pittsburgh because there you can find cheap cabs easily. Pittsburgh does not have many cabs running on the street and are very expensive. The cost of a ride cap in Bogota ($20) is the third of the cost in Pittsburgh ($60). 
In conclusion, Bogota and Pittsburgh are similar and different in many ways. Despite the fact that each city has many advantages and disadvantages over the other one, both cities have brought to me many good time and friends. Also, I have spent good times in both cities and that is why two places are in the bottom of my heart. If I have to choose one city, my favorite would be Bogota. The reason of my decision is that I belong to the city where I grew up. I am Colombian and my identity is in Bogota.

Happiness, defined in Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, is a state of mind or feeling such as contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, or joy. Although it is quite an abstract concept that a variety of philosophical, religious, psychological and biological approaches have been taken to defining it and identifying its sources, we have, of course, experienced happiness despite that we may just dimly understand its philosophical meaning. The causes of happiness, according to individual, may be diversified from each other. However, achievement, in most cases, can be the most rational explanation why we feel happy.

Happiness is highly associated with the achievement of our hard work. Needless to say, the more great success we achieve, the more strong happiness we will feel. The most important facet, which determines how happy we will be, is- how difficult the task is. One of my friends-a mountaineer, who has reached the summit of the Everest, always goes into rapture at the mere mention of his trip. He is forever talking about the dangerous, unknown cracks beneath the snow, the dramatically changing weather in the mountain area, the lack of oxygen that impedes his steps towards the acme. I also notice that, in his retrospection, the spectacular landscape on the crest of peak is mentioned many times. I once argued with him that if his purpose was as simple as to enjoy the view on the top of the mountain, he could have saved so much trouble and not have risked his life if he had taken a flight over the mountain. He scorned at my idea. Also, he clearly indicates that he would never be happy if the task were so easy to be achieved. 

In sum, happiness is related to achievement as the instance mentioned above. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"" ?written in the Declaration of Independence. Happiness, as the most precious part of life, is a reward to the person who rolls his sleeves for a hard task.

 I often see many people of obesity after moving to the US from Korea.When I saw them, they had some troubles in bending and moving.I know some people who are struggling with obesity. One of them is my husband. After he has become fat, he has got some problems such as physical diseases and psychological trouble. 
 First, as a result of fat, he gets physical diseases such as high blood pressure and hyperlipemia. When we married, he had a normal weight. However, he has gained his weight as time goes on, and eventually, he developed high blood pressure and hyperlipemia. As a result, he takes medicine every day for those diseases.
 Next, as a result of fat, he gets psychological troubles such as an imperative conception. For example, he always checks the amount of salt and calories, when he buys sauces and some foods. Fortunately, it is not very serious. In addition, whenever I make dishes, I always concern about the amount of salt I use. 
 In conclusion, as a result of obesity, people are struggling with physical diseases and psychological troubles even though these are not so serious.

This phenomenon causes serious obesity, because people eat high calory without exercise. As a result of that, obesity brings about two kinds of problem; physical issue and psychological issue.
 The first one is physical issue; that is, obesity can lead to a kind of disease, diabetes. Diabetes means that a body can not adjust the blood sugar level for itself. The main reason is that obesity hinders cell's performance. Insulin and glucagons are important hormones in our body. Of them, insulin is the most crucial hormone in that it can manage the blood sugar level. However, if a person's body becomes obese, his cells are already filled by fat. In addition, the cells can not execute insulin's function to exhaust fat, but the reason is not proved until now. Accordingly, blood sugar level increases high, and it converts to fat. As a result, that makes a vicious circle.
 Another one is psychological issue; that is, obesity can bring about depression. The general public care about their body shape and effort to make a good shape with diet, because they are very sensitive to be evaluated from others. For this reason, a slender shape gives people more confident than a fatty shape. In addition, this alludes that obesity can make people depressed. For example, suppose that a person could not find the suitable clothes to his body size when a person went to a clothing store. He may begin to think negative; his shape is bad, and the salesclerk jeered him. As accumulating these, he will lose his confidence little by little. Therefore, he will be depressed. 
 In conclusion, mental problem and physical problem are come from obesity. Concretely, obesity can bring about depression and diabetes. It hinders the adjustment of blood sugar level and makes people feel less confident.","Today, people eat at fast food shop and drive cars more frequently as their life becomes more hectic.

Poverty is one of the major problems that many countries around the world are facing today. Maybe poverty is considered one of the most important challenges for our generation, and as consequence many governments and non-profit organizations are working together to eliminate it. The importance of eliminating poverty is that it affects many aspects of the human life such as education, standard of living, and job quality. Between all these consequences, in my opinion the most important effect of poverty is not having access to education.
Education is considered a human right but in the case of poor people education can be a luxury. In poor families, all the members are working in any kind of activity, such us selling candies on the streets or helping the parents to grow the crop, to get money for covering some essential expenses like buying the food for everyday or collecting the money for paying the rent. Because the children who work on the streets or help on the crop are considered a source of money, the parents do not allow them to attend school, which generates a lack of education. As a consequence of that, poor people often get low-quality jobs, jobs which anyone can do, and that do not need any special knowledge so usually these jobs are also low-paying. These low-paid jobs do not allow poor people to get out from the poverty, and make their children to repeat the story. 
Poverty is one of the most important challenges that the world faces nowadays because its consequences can be seen in many aspects of the future generations such as education and quality of jobs. Recognizing that the people's life and welfare affect the countries' destiny, eliminating poverty becomes a priority. To be successful in this task, one solution may be to ensure access to education for poor people giving them the tools to get a better-paid jobs, which allow them to improve the standard of living or their family and decrease the possibility that their children experience the same situation.

Of course, we already know we have to recycle. However, it seems that it is not easy for us to start recycling voluntarily. To establish the successful recycling, the recycling rules should be obeyed not a person, but all of the residents. Thus, I think that it will be possible to recycle most of the trash if government, states, and all residents help each other try to comply with recycling rules.

 First of all, the government has to help all United States citizens to know why the recycling is necessary. They should know that we have no time to postpone starting recycle. Therefore, the government has a responsibility to educate their people necessities of recycling and how to recycle by television, radio, and any devices to be possible. These efforts may take longer time than we can expect. Although how much time will take to educate all the people, the government should never give up on the way. I am sure that the effort of the government will definitely succeed.

 Once the people know the necessity of recycling, it will be easier for States to help them recycle their garbage. Each State should make more trashcans that are separated by several categories such as glass, aluminum can, paper. We already have some of trashcans. However, it is too short to cover all of the recycling garbage. Furthermore, States ought to hire more people who oversee the violators and who recycle the renewable things instead of them. Last, the States can make a bill that makes people be obligated to buy special garbage bag when they though out it. To save the money, people should separate renewable ones with nonrenewable trash and though away only nonrenewable ones.

Everyone knows that many of the Earth's resources can not renewable and will eventually run out. At the same time, some of resource could be recycle. In order for us and our offspring's life, it is time to conserve and recycle these resources as possible as we can. A lot of materials can be recycled in our earth. How about you think this problem? I know that is a big problem in the word. There are many materials can be recycle in the world. For example:mental,water,paper,and so on.Now let me introduce some suggestions that can get people to recycle.

At first, I want to talk about metal recycle. That is invaluable resource. And its form is very complex. Numerous good products need metal. For example: Aluminum metal recycle is a very important part of any family and community recycling program. Aluminum metal recycle is one of the easiest things you can do to help the environment. Many factories can recycle metal from used TV, cell phone, and computer, so on. If these used products can be recycled and the factories are enough, the problem can be done well to some extent.

Second, our life can not continue without water. But the water resource can be used out, if we could not recycle it. Recycled water can satisfy most water demands, as long as it is adequately treated to ensure water quality appropriate for the use. How can we get water resource to be recycled? Ocean vaporizes water into sky, then the water fall into lake or river by rain, last it inflow Ocean again. It is the water recycles in nature. We know that we need to rely on freshwater. So we could not pollute the lake or river in the world. An alternative method is to recycle our used freshwater. If there is a day in the future, we can make sea water into freshwater. The problem can be solved thoroughly 

Thirdit is related to paper, as we known, maybe we couldn't imagine how much papers will be consumed in the world and in a second, nobody couldn't imagine that's second consume of paper means how many trees down and how much dangerous factors will influence environment. But all of us knew it is not so difficult to recycle papers, we only need do two things, one is separate used paper from other rubbish, and another is place it in recycle box. Questions are whether everyone is so patience that he or she could separate all of used paper. 

There are many other materials that could be recycled in the world. Weather it is can be done well, it is responsible for everyone to think about and take action. If we can get them to recycle, we could save many nature resources. For example: could you pick up each used envelop and each ad you read? If you can do it, could you place them recycle box every time? So do it your best.","Everyone knows that many of the Earth's resources can not renewable and will eventually run out.

The tree most commonly proposed alternative to this overpopulation problem are making a family plan, law to have an abortion, and limiting amount of baby in family by the government.

 The fist solution is to limit amount of baby each family by the government. In China, couples are penalized financially if they have more than one child. This way seem cruel, but the ""one-child policy"" is beginning to have an effect in the world's most population.

 Another solution to the overpopulation is every woman who is pregnant, but who does not want to give birth, should be allowed by law to have an abortion. The positive of the abortion can stop an unnecessary birth. For example, couples have many children want to stop pregnant, but if they have a baby again, they want the abortion. Now, however, the abortion is illegal. We need a legal abortion.

 The best solution, making a family plan, is decreased the population of the world. For example, In Korea, couples were planed the family plan by government.

Therefore, we should try our best to conserve natural materials and recycle them. However, how can we encourage ourselves to do recycle and influence each other? There are three points presented as followed.

 First, the government has to educate people to do recycle because some people do not have enough knowledge about recycling. For example, the school's teachers should teach children how to classify the trash according to different materials such as plastic, glass, and paper at school. In addition, the communities and companies also have responsibility for educating and giving information about recycling to their citizens and employees, Therefore, people learn why we should do recycle to protect our resources and how to do it; I believe many people are willing to take care of our earth.

 Second, the government encourages people to do recycle, thus, they have to give people some rewards to praise them. For instance, in Taiwan, our government urges that we should classify the trash and recycle. Moreover, our government gives some rewards of cheer to people who do recycle such as furniture, food, or money. In fact, it is very important to give some feedback when people do well because people need someone to support them to do and it is also worth giving some rewards to make our environmental becoming better.

 Third, the government can legislate against people who do not do recycle because sometimes people just rely on the rules and laws to avoid getting troubles. On the other hand, when the government makes a law to protect our earth, people will know this is serious problem. Thus, people will face this issue to obey the law. In addition, when people are not willing to do recycle, the government can give some punishments such as taking a class about why we should do recycle or giving a find.

 To sum up, we should treasure our earth's resources and realize we will use up all the valuable natural resources. It is not only to educate people, but also to give some rewards and to make a law. Also, we should encourage people who are around us.","Nowadays doing recycle is becoming a serious issue because one day many of the earth's resources will run out.

Were the boots, the trash, the newspaper, which were throw away, really useless? The things above seem the most wasteful. It's terrible to infer the waste, which are thrown away by the thousands and millions people in the world, from the rate of one person. So, it's important and necessary to get people to recycle. It is well know that recycling can reduce waste, conserve environment. But people are often reluctant to do recycling. What ideas do we have about getting people to recycle? The three solutions, which can be proposed, are to help young generation form the conception of recycling, to improve whole society conservation efforts, and to set up funds for featuring in advanced recycling technique.

The first solution is to help young generation form the conception of recycling. Young people are easy to convince to get advantageous habit. According to the feature, the school, which is from pre-school to high school, should set up course of conservation to have students learn the knowledge about recycling, to teach them how to recycle and how to converse our environment, and at last to get them form the conception of recycling during their growing up. Once the young generation forms the conception, they will vie everything from a recycling perspective. These will be power force to meet our society now and future needs. For example, a twelve-year-old boy, who was reported on TV news time, designed a set of equipment for recycling used water to flush his home toilet. This is a good example about the effect of recycling education to the young people.

The second solution is to improve whole society conservation efforts. In the world, most of people know why we need to conserve our environment, but they often neglect their efforts, and don't see the seriousness of conversation now. So, they are reluctant to recycle a piece of newspaper, a pair of shoes etc. It's evident to improve whole society conservation efforts and to have the recognition about recycling are more necessary. For example, shops should make guests reuse the plastic bags, media should do publicity work to change people's attitudes to the recycling.

The finally solution is to set up funds for featuring in advanced recycling technique. It's easy to say the word ""recycling"" or ""to recycle"". How do the people conveniently recycle the used things and efficiently reuse them? It's complex for people. Government should set up funds to encourage and reward engineer and scientist to find the method to help people recreate fantastic, useful product via the recycling things. These will cause people to do recycling in more easy ways.

Colombia is a country with a high level of violence, organized crime and kidnapping. These are big problems in this country. There are many explanations for the high percentage of crimes. The principal reasons are the limited job opportunities and lack of education for the people. In this country there are two social scales: rich people, who are the owner of the factories and poor people, who are professional people, workers, unemployed and people without any education. Besides, there is another scale that is classified as extreme poverty. The hanger, stimulate to people to commit crimes to obtain some of the money, producing of this way violence. If the government has some politics to fight against the poverty, it is probably that decrease the crimes. Politics that can incorporate many opportunities of job, opportunities to buy housing, and more investment in education,

The first solution could be increasing the opportunities of job for the people. For example, in the world there are many lack of nourishment and Colombia can produce different types of foods like rice, bean, plantain, banana, milk, tomato, potato, other fruits and vegetables. Colombia is a country with fertile ground and with different kind of the weather in all the year. The government could produce jobs for people, with more investment in agriculture. These products can be of exportation toward other countries. If people have job, the crimes in the country can decrease.

Another solution would be to increase the investment in housing for poor people. This is an important point, it could be of great help for people, because with job and housing people wouldn't need to commit some sort of crime to survive. It is important that the families feel protected for the their government and that they don't rely on the crimes to obtain some money due to shortage of opportunities to buy the housing.

The best solution is the increase in the investment in education. People can acquire more awareness and personal formation. The education is an aspect very important in the people because with knowledge a country can become powerful. The knowledge is a power social, politic, religious, economic. Also, the education provides better style of life and high qualities of thinking. People need better chance to acquire the education and like that the knowledge could be a definitive solution for the crime.

In conclusion, there are many factors to explain the high crimes rate like lack of job and opportunities to buy housing, although the most important reason is the shortage of education in people. Therefore, if the government concentrate his effort in offer most opportunities to acquire job and housing, it could help a decrease the crimes. Nevertheless, it wouldn't be a strategy with better results than if the government emphasize in education for people. The government should take better decisions to solve this problem.

Since that the whole world is growing smaller, having command of a second or even a third language is becoming one of the required skills. That is why we need to know how to learn a new language. Here are some of the important steps in the process.

Firstly, you must learn the alphabet of course, which is the basic. Basing on my own experience, it is really important to practice and make your hand-writing perfect. This part of time is a perfect period to do so. The good beginning is half of the success, make sure you have a beautiful hand-writing before you do anything else. Eventually, looking at good hand-writing will keep your interest in the language.

Secondly, make your pronunciation as nature as you can. In order to get rid of your accent, try as hard as you can to be surrounded by the language you want to learn. You can post pieces of paper that has the language on anyplace where you live. Get any vocal material you can get that contains the language, play it no matter when, listen to it and if you are free, repeat after it. It is a very good measure to practice you listening and speaking also. If you knew someone who was a native speaker, never let him/her go, talk to him/her and never be afraid of making mistakes. That is a good chance to perfect your pronunciation, it will help on your vocabulary as well.

Speaking of vocabulary, that is the last thing I want to emphasize, you must have large vocabulary. Too bad that we only have one way to largen it is reciting. Although it is not a good way to learn a word, but before you can speak the language with no problem, you must recite. Making example sentences is a good idea to help reciting. I've also tried to relate them with something I already knew, that will also help you to remember. Review the words you've recited periodically, or you would forgot anything you've recited in 3 months(like what happened to the sat vocabulary I've recited for the test, I cannot even tell one now - after not reviewing for 5 months)

There are many other things that are important to take command of a new language, you should find the most important one yourself. But never forget to maintain the interest in the language, or you'll never learn the language well.

Many peopleespecially working mothers often complain about difficultly finding free time for themselves during a busy day. I have the same opinion. In our life, we need to work to raise children, we need to study to improve our skill, as well as we have a lot of housework and chores to do. We are busy every day. How to acquire free time during a busy day? I have some tips like making a schedule and strictly act your schedule and buy semi-manufactured food to share with you.

The first important tip is to make a schedule. According to your situation, you can work out the schedule which could organize your action in regular and efficiency. For example, I am a housewife, I also take full-time ELI classes. So, I am very busy in my school day. Except taking whole day class, I have to spend several hours to cook dinner and clear up my home after the classes. However, I found that I do cook in the morning more efficient than in the afternoon, I schedule myself to cook dinner in the morning. In the afternoon, I come back home from school with tired steps, I have the dinner. I only clean up my home, then I can enjoy my several hours free time before going to bed. I can watch TV, do homework or go to internet. I can do anything that I like to do.

The second tip is to strictly act your schedule. You already have had a good schedule, you carry out it, then can earn your free time during your busy day. If you don't carry out in accordance with it, you are possibly difficult to snatch leisure from a busy day. For example, I have had the schedule. I experienced it that is good for me. If I didn't schedule myself strictly, my free time that I have talked in second paragraph would be the cooking time.

Finally, semi-manufactured food can help you save cooking time. As we know, eating fast food too much is not healthy, and eating at restaurant every day is more expensive to the most of family. Cooking by yourself will spend a considerable of time. The things like cleaning vegetable, processing meat, frying and boiling food are all need to take long time to do. So, buying semi-manufactured food is a easy way to cook, and also can save your time.

Finding a free time during a busy day is really not an easy thing. But you schedule yourself, and organize every work that you have to do, and sometimes buy semi-manufactured food to cook for your meal, you will find your free time.

Driver's license means not only a permit for driving a car but also an identification of the States. However, if you don't have a driver's license, you don't have to worry about that. There are three steps for you as an international student to get easily driver's license: preparation for necessary documents, driver's test on computer based system, and actual driving test on the road.

The article Easy Living Sherpa write: ""Owning a home has been romanticized and called the ""dream"" of every American.""(Easy Living Sherpa, Wednesday, June 17, 2009). It's evident that everyone yearns to possess a house or an apartment. In people's whole life, most people will spend their half life time to stay at home, in where we enjoy with our families, we feel delighted and leisure by our private space. We will feel free to do our favorite relaxations. A satisfied house or an apartment can cheer you up. However, a house or an apartment, which would you prefer to live into? That will depend on your economy, your lifestyle and the housework you will have. These three aspects will affect your decision.

One of reasons that people give for not owning a home is they feel that they don't have enough money for a down payment. Houses are too expensive or they don't feel they have good enough credit. Buying and owning a home takes more work than renting. (Easy Living Sherpa, Wednesday, June 17, 2009). Almost houses will spend your huge money to buy. Even you have bought a new house, the following things that you have to think about are yard, decoration and furniture. These also will spend you a considerable amount of money. Comparing a house, an apartment will be cheaper to buy. Because the area of an apartment is smaller than a house, the spending of decoration and furniture will be less, and you do not have a yard, so you will pay nothing for it. If people pay great attention on the money problem, they would prefer an apartment. Personal economic condition is one aspect that affects people's preference. 

Another aspect is personal lifestyle. People have varied personal lifestyle. Some like to be quiet, some like to live with others. If you live in a house, you will have a wide, private living space, a yard and a parking space. You will be free to do anything that you would like. You don't need to worry about disturbing your neighbor when you sing or vacuum or have a party in your home. You also don't fear to be disturbed by your neighbor. On the contrary, living in an apartment, you always care about whether your action will annoy you neighbor. You still mind that you are annoyed. For example, I am living in an apartment, my neighbor is a young lady. Sometimes, she comes back home very late at night, when I fall asleep, she comes back home, then I awake to the sound of toilet flushing, walking and washing. If you live in a house, you certainly do not suffer this. If you like quiet, private living environment, to buy a house is a good choice. 

The finally aspect is housework. It's obvious, living in a house, you will involve in a amount of housework. You need to mow and water your glass, to root out the weeds, to trim trees, to plant flower, to paint the wall of house and so on. All these labor work are hard and bored, but you have to do. If you live in an apartment, you will be free from these chores. You will have a lot of personal leisure time to entertain. If you are weary of this housework, you would prefer an apartment.

Living in a house and living in an apartment both exist in advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, I think the economy, the lifestyle and the housework that you have to do are main aspects that will be the determinant which influence your decision.

There are several types of public transportation that people usually use in big cities, such as buses, subways. However, if you have experiences to live in different cities for a while  like me, you should be able to find the differences about the public  transportation in  those cities. For example, after I came to Pittsburgh, I have noticed that the situation of using the public transportation in Pittsburgh is not as same as in 
Tokyo.

The first thing I noticed that public buses in Pittsburgh are the most common transportation. The bus system covers many areas of the city and nearby suburbs, and it is especially extensive in downtown Pittsburgh. Although It is convenient for commuters to choose because there are a lot of bus routes connect downtown to North side, South side, Oakland and other neighborhoods of Pittsburgh(ANON_URLSITE), the frequency of  some buses is not enough. Sometimes, the bus does come on time, if you miss the last one, you have to wait for the next one for some time. At the beginning I lived here, I couldn't adapt to the bus commute, but soon later I have been getting used to take buses, and appreciate the benefits of using buses. For the Pitt students ,faculties, it's so great that taking any public transportation just for free. In Tokyo, buses are also useful public transportation, but usually people just use subways. Buses are often used by people who are living in local areas, where the subway station is far from their houses. Because Tokyo is a very big and busy city, the heavy traffic on the road delays commuters in the weekday commute time, so most people use subways more often than use buses.That's why  it is not easy to find a bus stop in downtown areas.

The  next I want to compare Pittsburgh with Tokyo is the subway. As many people known, Tokyo's railways and subways is very developed, and it's punctual schedule is also famous. There are two subway operators in Tokyo, ""Tokyo Metro"" and ""Toei Subway"". At the entrance to each station, you will see the subway sign and the name of the subway station. Even though in the same subway system, there are some reticulated and complicated lines with different colors you have to pay attention to. Therefore, be sure to remember the station name and number, and line color of the subway line you want to ride. It is very convenient because of  radiating  in all directions around Tokyo. On the other hand, during rush hours on weekdays, It's extremely crowded. In Pittsburgh, the 'T' is Pittsburgh's small but clean and safe 25.2-mile subway and light rail system. It was built in 1984, serves downtown Pittsburgh and several communities south of the city. ( Getting to & Around Pittsburgh, Albrecht Powell, ANON_URLSITE). This is the only subway in Pittsburgh and the carriage of the 'T' is not as long as ""Tokyo Metro""or ""Toei Subway"". It has a really short simple route, unlike the subway in Tokyo, just limited residents can use it as normally.   

In conclusion, after comparing the public transportation of these two cities, I realize what kind of public transportation is more suitable to citizens should depend on the situation of that city. The composition of population, the size of the city, the geographical conditions, and other physical reasons are important factors for making the differences between Pittsburgh and Tokyo.

To live in another country was my dream; I wanted to experience other citys' customs. It doesn't matter weather the city is in my native country or not. Now, my dream has come true; the city I am living now is Pittsburgh. I am here for studying English and I'll study for my bachelor also. I have been here 5 months, although I have adapted my new live, I still miss my home town sometimes. I compare the difference between my hometown and Pittsburgh: the weather, the food and the environment.

I am from Taiwan, and my hometown is called Tainan. The weather there is always hot, even in winter it is not as cold as Pittsburgh's weather; it is warmer than Pittsburgh's. When I was in Tainan I never saw snow before, but after I came here I saw a lot of snow. I was so happy at first, however I am tired about seeing snow now. Also in Tainan, it only rain about two months in summer, unlike Pittsburgh, it's also rain in winter. 

When I came here, I ate much American food than I did before. I noticed that people in here are much salad, pizzas and hamburgs. Also I found that the American food is saltier than Taiwan's. The most different is that it is more convenient in my hometown than in Pittsburgh. I can go out to buy any food whenever I want, on the contrary, I can't do the same thing in Pittsburgh.

There is another different, the environment. Most houses in Tainan were made by concrete, on the other hand, houses here are made by either wood or limestone which have stable framework. In my hometown, there are a lot of historic spots, but in Pittsburgh here has many museums instead.

I do like Pittsburgh, the people are friendly, and here has a lof of museum, such as art museum or history museum. Not only museum, Pittsburgh has high quality of art. Although the weather here in winter is too cold for me, but I have chance to see snow. I like to travel, and experience diverse customs in different city, even though I feel it is good for me to stay in my hometown. However I never regret that I choose Pittsburgh as my second hometown.

When I was elementary school student, I lived in Ansan, which is one of suburban cities. And when I entered middle school, I moved to Seoul, which is an urban city. As a result, I know the life of both urban city and suburban city. I'm going to compare two cities to give some information to people who will move to near Seoul. Although the two cities have so many differences, I chose three points which is crucial for choosing a living place: traffic, crowdedness, and housing costs.
First of all, traffic is important to a person who has a job in Seoul. Seoul has good public transportations such as subway, buses, and taxies. The subway system in Seoul has nine lines and is composed very well, so you can go everywhere you want by subway. In the case of buses, they also have lots of lines, and a road which is only for bus makes you can go to your destination in time. Taxies are good transportation too. The cost of taxi is very cheap, comparing with in the states, and you can catch taxies anywhere and anytime. However, if you not use the public transportation but use your own car, you will be suffered from traffic jam on the road. Ansan's condition is different from Seoul. It has only one subway line and not so many bus lines, but the roads are straight and wide. Consequently, you don't need to be worried about traffic jam if you have own car.
Second, a lot of people care about crowdedness because some people don't like to go to a place which is crowded. You might know that Seoul is very crowded. It is in the ranking which indicates the crowdedness of some cities in the world. You could see many people everywhere in especially at some famous places in Seoul. In the case of public transportation, people describe that it's like they are in hell at the time of commuting. Besides, if you want to eat dinner at some popular spots, you need to wait in line or reserve a seat for you. On the other hand, Ansan is one of tranquil cities. It has sort of extensive land if its population is compared with Seoul's one. Because of this, there is lots of space for making green tract of land, which could make you feel comfortable.
The most important thing of choosing a living place is housing costs because people want to find a house which price is they can afford to. As you expected, Seoul's housing cost is so expensive. Most people want to live in Seoul because Seoul has many companies, good schools, and cultural things to enjoy. Due to gathering people, Seoul doesn't have enough room to live. That's why Seoul's housing cost is so high. But if you have same amount of money, you can buy much bigger house in Ansan. Like other suburban cities, it has plenty place to build house. Moreover, it's kind of new city, most of the houses are cleaner and fancier than the houses in Seoul. 
I know it's still hard for you to choose one place. But in my case, I like to live in Seoul instead of Ansan because I don't have a car even a driver's license. So, the public transportation is the most important thing for me. In addition to this, I don't need such a big house because I need a room for only me. However, if I'm getting old and have a family, Ansan will be better for me at that time because I will get a car and have some children.

In addition to this, I don't need such a big house because I need a room for only me. However, if I'm getting old and have a family, Ansan will be better for me at that time because I will get a car and have some children. Florida, R. (2008). Who's your city? New York: Basic Books.","It's difficult to choose between urban city and suburban city when people decide their living place because both of them have not only strong points but also weak points. the world is, in many ways, spiky with population, opportunity, innovation, and money increasingly coalescing in metropolitan areas worldwide. When I was elementary school student, I lived in Ansan, which is one of suburban cities. And when I entered middle school, I moved to Seoul, which is an urban city. As a result, I know the life of both urban city and suburban city. I'm going to compare two cities to give some information to people who will move to near Seoul. Although the two cities have so many differences, I chose three points which is crucial for choosing a living place: traffic, crowdedness, and housing costs. First of all, traffic is important to a person who has a job in Seoul. Seoul has good public transportations such as subway, buses, and taxies. The subway system in Seoul has nine lines and is composed very well, so you can go everywhere you want by subway. In the case of buses, they also have lots of lines, and a road which is only for bus makes you can go to your destination in time. Taxies are good transportation too. The cost of taxi is very cheap, comparing with in the states, and you can catch taxies anywhere and anytime. However, if you not use the public transportation but use your own car, you will be suffered from traffic jam on the road. Ansan's condition is different from Seoul. It has only one subway line and not so many bus lines, but the roads are straight and wide. Consequently, you don't need to be worried about traffic jam if you have own car. Second, a lot of people care about crowdedness because some people don't like to go to a place which is crowded. You might know that Seoul is very crowded. It is in the ranking which indicates the crowdedness of some cities in the world. You could see many people everywhere in especially at some famous places in Seoul. In the case of public transportation, people describe that it's like they are in hell at the time of commuting. Besides, if you want to eat dinner at some popular spots, you need to wait in line or reserve a seat for you. On the other hand, Ansan is one of tranquil cities. It has sort of extensive land if its population is compared with Seoul's one. Because of this, there is lots of space for making green tract of land, which could make you feel comfortable. The most important thing of choosing a living place is housing costs because people want to find a house which price is they can afford to. As you expected, Seoul's housing cost is so expensive. Most people want to live in Seoul because Seoul has many companies, good schools, and cultural things to enjoy. Due to gathering people, Seoul doesn't have enough room to live. That's why Seoul's housing cost is so high. But if you have same amount of money, you can buy much bigger house in Ansan. Like other suburban cities, it has plenty place to build house. Moreover, it's kind of new city, most of the houses are cleaner and fancier than the houses in Seoul. I know it's still hard for you to choose one place. But in my case, I like to live in Seoul instead of Ansan because I don't have a car even a driver's license. So, the public transportation is the most important thing for me. In addition to this, I don't need such a big house because I need a room for only me.

People in China used to all use the Windows system, but there is a growing trend of using the Mac system now. Among my friends, many are beginning to use Mac. I used to be satisfied with my computer with a Windows system, and thought that Mac was difficult to use and un convient since many programs cannot be run on ot. But when I got my first MacBook as a reward of entering Pitt, my opinion changed.

After using my MacBook, I found that the Mac system is not hard to use at all. It is even easier for beginners to learn than the Windows system! I think why people think it is hard to use is beacause that the way the Mac system rens is totally different from the one that the Windows does. The ""draging"" is perfect and really fen to use.

Taking iWork and iLife, which are products specialized for the Mac system, for example, iWork works even better than the Microsoft Word, Powerpoint and Excel, which are the triditional applications for the Windows system, not mentioning how fantastic iLife is comparing to Phtoshop, which is also a famous program for the Windows. You can organize your photos, videos however you like(iPhoto'09).Just as it was said on the advertisment of iWork (New in ANON_NAME_0'09), ""Now getting started is quicker. And the results are more impressive than ever."", you would never forget the feeling after you have tried the Mac system.

There is another thing that I like for the Mac system. When I use a computer with the Windows system, I always got trouble with the virus thing, but there is no virus problem in the Mac system!

However it is true that in nowadays the Windows system is better. You can find more applications that are really useful designed just for it, and you can get more entertainment when you use the Windows system - which you cannot find for the Mac system. In addition, there are reasons for why more people use the Windows instead of the Mac system, in somewhat way, it is better than the Mac system.

Both the two systems have its own trait, and it is up to you which you you should chose. For me, the Mac is better.

Also, both use a screen, a keyboard, and a mouse as their output devices. However, some differences between PCs and Macs separate them to two users. Even though I'm a PC user, I have used Mac several times. After that, I always choose a PC in terms of changeable hardware, cost, and software, especially gaming. 
 When I want to buy a Mac, I can barely select other hardware in a Mac, which means there are not varieties of choices. It is a complete computer. All hardware in Mac is chosen by Apple, and they are perfectly optimized for Mac so that I can't improve Mac's performance even if I want. However, when I want to have a PC, I can build it. I can choose every part of hardware in the PC. Therefore, I can build the PC that is faster than Mac and can have many options. 
 I can also say that PC can be cheaper than Mac. As I mentioned above, Macs are complete computers, and it means Apple uses specific manufacturer's hardware, so I need to pay whole money for the Mac. However, I can adjust the amount of money that I'm supposed to pay because I can choose hardware in a PC. The fact that I can buy each part of hardware means that there are a great many of manufacturer in PC market. They have been competing, so hardware prices are slightly cheaper than the hardware in Mac. According to Tom Samiljan (2008), PC's performance and quality depend on what kinds of manufacturer I choose, whereas Apple uses their own hardware for Macs(Tom Samiljan, 2000, para 14). Definitely, I can reduce expenses by choosing hardware.
Recently, much software for Macs has been developed and released, but software for PCs is still more diverse than for Macs. Especially, game software, which is related to a huge part of PC market, tends to be developed much more for PCs. Statistically; PC users in the world are approximately 90%, whereas Mac users are roughly lower than 10%. In addition, it needs converting process to play some games in the Mac environment because PC and Mac has completely different software system, which means that they are not compatible each other. Therefore, it is not advantageous to convert the games from PC to Mac in terms of population in Mac. According to Tom Samiljan (2008), ""Every major hit,. From the ""Unreal Tournament', and 'Quake' series to 'Age of Empires' and 'Command and conquer', comes out for the PC first, and most PC games never comes out for the Mac at all.""(Tom Samiljan, 2008, para 22). Finally, it is certain that there is no choice except PC to play games.
Although there are several different categories to compare each other, possibility to change hardware, cost, and diversity in software can be primarily our interests in terms of reducing expenses and purpose when we buy a computer. Moreover, many people tend to buy a Mac because its design is cool, and it makes people pay attention to the Mac users. If you are the person who only concerns performance and money and wants to have experiences in various software, PC will be the best choice.

 I have lived in Shadyside every since I moved to Pittsburgh. My lease has to be renewed by end of this month, so before signing up for another whole year I'd like to do a little bit of comparison myself. Since, I have a couple of friends who are happily settled in the North Pittsburgh area, I searched online and found an apartment with a rent of $821.00 for one bedroom (ANON_URLSITE, N.D.), which is about same as what I'm paying now. My comparison apartment in North Pittsburgh is Bear Run Village, 100 Bear Run Drive, Pittsburgh., PA 15237.
 First, the apartment in North Pittsburgh is more spacious, and has nice features that my current apartment doesn't have. Per ANON_URLSITE (N.D.), the Bear Run Apt. has a swimming pool, a fitness center, a barbeque area with grills in the community. The Apartment also has fireplaces, large patios, high ceilings, and in-suite washer & dryers. Those are all nice features I really want. I can totally ficture myself swimming, having a barbeque, and doing a laundry from the convenience of my home.
 Secondly, neighborhood of North Pittsburgh is much quieter than Shadyside. My apartment is located right next to a railroad on which a couple of trains run everyday. I used to wake up in the middle of night because of all the noise. In addition, students in Shadyside sometimes can be very loud. One night last week, people were shouting and honking horns, so I looked outside but I just didn't know what it was about. I knew what caused it when I turned on T.V. That night Penguins finally won the Stanley cup. I believe people in North Pittsburgh were sound asleep at that time. 
 Last but not least, the apartment in North Pittsburgh requires longer commuting time. Based on Google maps, it takes 23 minutes from the Bear run apartment and 6 minutes from my apartment to the University of Pittsburgh. We have to cross a bridge to come to the Pitt. It means heavy traffic. If any event, accident, or construction occurs, it becomes much worse because there are not many options for detour. 
 I compared my apartment with one in North Pittsburgh, and found that there are some pros and cons in both apartments. North Pittsburgh apartment has nicer features and quieter, but average commute time is longer. I was so happy to learn that the apartment in North had in-suite washer and dryers that I wanted to call the apartment and sign a contract right away. How convenient would it be to have washer and dryers inside my unit? And heated swimming pool? I couldn't ask for more.
 However, I decided to stay with my apartment because of the long commute time. My husband is a Postdoc and usually goes to his lab several times a day because of his research schedule. I don't want to see him drive back and forth, especially in winter time because of the notorious snow. I will have to stay in Shadyside for a little longer than I'd like to.

Therefore they feel that they don't need to live together.

The economic parameters are common in almost the entire world, because the economical system is the same. Basically many countries are related through on international trade, such as importation or exportation of Raw Materials. Then, when some country has an economical problem, affect directly on job's offer (lower), and less consumption (and a lot of other things), also we can add too much educational offer. Those are some causes that affect unemployment.

The first cause is the less job offer. Under economics' problems many stores and companies doesn't find people who want to work because owner companies don't have adequate earnings, therefore they don't take on people or they offer low incomes. Then a lot of people are taking off of their jobs and others don't want taking job under that term. 

The second cause is less consumption. That is a vicious cycle because a less consumption as a result unemployment and when there are unemployment people don't buy anything because they don't have money. Then the only way to tear down that cycle is giving subsides (from the government) to companies, thus companies must give employment to people. 

In another hand, the educational offer is so much, then many people have the same major, that reduce the opportunities to find job, because places to work are the same. For example in Chile there are a lot of lawyers and business managers and they don't have so much work's opportunities or they have low incomes.

In conclusion, unemployment causes are a lot, but economical system has some unsolved problems and that produce vicious cycles. Thus economical system should be helped by the government of each country; also government should be information about how many people are studying the same major. Finally if the previous causes are being solving, job's offer will not be lower. Could it be possible?

In my point of view, happiness is caused by the three main factors: mental health, satisfying and secure personal living conditions and moral values.

The first important cause of happiness is to possess mental health. Beside hereditary reason, there are a lot of people suffering mental trouble because of fierce competition, high debt and high-speed life in daily work and study nowadays. These can bring the greatest pressure and spirit misery, and at last cause people's mental illness. The effects of mental illness can be disability and premature death and so on. So, if you want to be happy, you must have a good mental health. It's very necessary for you to acquire your happiness. Good mental health is above wealth. 

The second important cause of happiness is to have satisfying and secure personal living conditions. That means you should have a satisfying work, a lovely private life and a secure community. In our work, in our family, and in our neighborhood, we all hope that we can set up good and peaceful relationships with families, colleagues, friends and neighbors. These relatives are the best guarantee of our happiness. I think the three greatest disasters for people are unemployment, marriage break-up and unsafe living environment. We need a reasonable employment protection, a stable relationships and a safe neighborhood which can bring us happiness. 

The last important cause of happiness is moral values. The moral values include the personal responsibility to families and society and professional ethic. The moral principles guide to raise our children and respect the elderly people, to do charity to help poor people, to set targets to reduce emissions and waste from our actions, to contribute to local economies through the wages and taxes and to produce safety, responsible and accessible product to customers and etc. Our moral values can made our society decrease cheating violation and crime, and full of kindness and happiness.

Everyone is eager for happiness. It's obvious, possessing a mental health, gaining satisfying and secure personal living conditions, and having moral values are essential causes of happiness. We chase our happiness, meanwhile, we also should remember to help others to own it. The world will be ideal, when most people feel happy.

Historically, the poverty has generated many problems to all the countries in the world. Always, it has been a political issue very difficult to resolve since all the economic systems have had capitalist framework producing that our society have more affluent people but also more poor people. All the socialist system tries to give more opportunity to the poor people, however, the interest of these governments to invest much of their resources in the military infrastructures have produced that the economy of theses countries do not grow. Therefore, the poverty is the main factor of many conflicts in the world such as the violence, illiteracy, and starvation.
First, one of the underlying reasons of the poverty is the violence that has caused murders and insecurity in the countries. A country cannot progress due to the high rate of mortality caused because of the crimes. Thereby, it produces that the economy stop and cannot keep on growing more. For instance, if a country has many crimes no company would think in investing its money in an insecure place since the company can be victim of that crude violence. Then, it generates unemployment in the population. Finally, the violence is generated because of the poverty that affects the stability of the economies of the countries.

Second, if people do not have money to pay the elementary school, the high school, or the college, it would produce a surge in the illiteracy of the population of the countries. For example, many parts of the world the elementary school and the high school have high costs for the families with low economic resources. Therefore, it is very difficult to pay the education since they prefer to invest their few money in food and housing than education. They struggle everyday to earn money with the goal of covering all their needs.

Third, the starvation is a catastrophic factor of the poverty due to the huge amount of people that die because of scarcity of food. For example, there are many places in where people live with malnutrition. That's why; there are many illness or epidemics in the inhabitants and many people die. Some areas such as Africa or South America have this problem constantly and it is increasing every day. Many famous have done campaign to eliminate the starvation.

In conclusion, there are three principal effects of the poverty that have affected worldwide society such as violence, illiteracy and starvation. The social conflicts involve the poverty that is the most enormous problem in the world. There are no forceful proposals to resolve this situation. Therefore, if the governments do not help to figure out a soon answer, the world will become more chaotic and will have more inhospitable places to live.

In this world, every individual is unique. All people have their own personalities, outlook on life and values. In a certain meaning, all these are influenced by their different experiences and surrounding environments of childhood, such as families, school lives and social experiences.

First of all, family is the most effective factor to child's growth. Their parents are not only the parents but also the first teacher. What kind of good habits should children be able to get into depend on the family education from their parents. If the parents are traditional, conservative on educating their children, the children will get the basic manners easily and will get to learn how behave themselves better. This is very important thing for people's growth. 
Here is an example that about an American actor whose name is Wentworth Miller was interviewed as a guest in some talk show of Fenghuang TV(Chinese TV department), he talked about his childhood, especially about his parents who were keeping a strict hand over him. He owes his ability in success to his parents. So it's obviously to see that the family is how constructive to child's growth. 

In addition, when children start to study in school, the school life will become a main part in their student's lives. The activities of school are not only for learning knowlege in classes, but also for making friends and getting used to staying the social life of the school. These things are really rich and colorful for children to make experiences. Sometimes , the teachers are also required fair treatment to offer opportunities for each student . Some of children are shy, so if the teacher doesn't encourage them to join the group activities, they probably would be isolated from others. Of course this is not just that teachers have to take the responsibility for children, parents are also must cooperate with teachers in educating their children. Usually people who graduated from schools have their good or bad memories which affect them make the next or future decisions , such as deciding to become a good teacher like their respected and beloved teachers. Therefor, school life is a very important element for influencing people's life.

Finally , people, even children can not live without any social work , that means people always make the social experiences though living in reality and nature. For example, children like to spend holidays with families or friends, they could enjoy any small thing in naive way. By playing games with friends or doing activities with families, they will build cognition to this world, in other words, a sense of justice, a sense of commitment to society, a view of natural science. According to a research report, most Americans who attended religious services at some point during childhood look back on their experience in a positive way. 66%percent believe their religious attendance before age 18 gave them a good moral foundation. ( Most adults who attended religious services as a child are glad they did, Ellison Research, ANON_URLPAGE) On the other hand, if children dislike to join those kinds of activities, they maybe will lose some ability to live well with others.

In conclusion, whatever people recognize the importance about how their childhood experiences influence their lives. Though , people live in different countries with different customs, in fact, those experiences have been exactly affecting their lives so far, even the future.

 'Must love dogs' (2004) is a title of the movie about a couple who have met via an online dating website and fell in love with each other.
 Although the movie was well storied and funny, finding your other half online seemed a little bit unrealistic at that time. Until then, not so many people had imagined that they could actually marry somebody they had met online.
 However, online dating sites have become very popular these days. Seems like whenever you flip through TV channels, at least one channel is airing an advertisement for an online dating website. What have made them so popular in such a short period? Easy internet access, busy lifestyle, and late marriage could be the major three reasons. 
 Easy internet access has allowed more people log onto online dating websites. Nowadays, we cannot imagine our life without internet. People spend so much time online shopping, reading articles, or just surfing websites with no specific purpose.
 It's not just when you're at home or office. Now you can get internet access almost anytime anywhere. More people are carrying a notebook or a netbook, a smaller version of a notebook which makes it even more portable. You also have I-pods, blackberries, and even good old cell phones are internet-ready these days. Besides, more restaurants and coffee shops are providing free wireless internet services. While you're waiting for your friend on a big comfy couch with your favorite coffee, you can log on to the dating sites you have registered and check if someone has replied to your ads. 
 In addition, because of the busy life style of the modern society many people simply don't find time to meet people and date in the real world. 
Actually, online dating is much easier and faster than the traditional dating. For a traditional dating it usually takes months for people to ask somebody out for a date, go on a couple of dates, and decide whether to continue to meet each other. If it doesn't work out very well you have to move onto another person. But sadly, you have already wasted months on the wrong person.
 But online dating is totally different. You can search people's profiles that mach your criteria and send messages to more than one person at the same time. So even if some of them say 'not interested', you can just set up dates with others who actually reply 'yes' without wasting any time during the whole process.
 Finally, late marriage has become one of the reasons more people are searching on websites hoping to find their partners. As people get married much later than they used to, they tend to get less chance to meet somebody special to them. People used to meet their loved ones at schools through classes or activities all the time. After graduation, there aren't too many chances to meet someone like that. To make it worse, many companies have no dating policies because they have become so paranoid about sexual harassment lawsuits.
 As internet becomes more accessible, dating websites have become more available to people who need them. There also have been high demands because many people don't have time or chance to meet somebody. 
 For those reasons, a dating system has evolved and your date actually might be just a couple of clicks away.
 However there is an important thing for everybody to remember. No matter how easy and fast it becomes to meet somebody online, all the relationship has to be cherished and respected.

Y,K2657,26289,al5,Korean,Male,534,5,w,3447,1,630,630,630,"Obesity has become one of the major problems in our society. Obesity can cause other physical disease. Even sometimes it is the cause of mental disease. Obviously, obesity threats public health. So, countless people have been trying to remove their obesity with a lot of solutions, such as special exercise machines, particular food or substances, and books that has useful information about diet, but it has not been solved completely. People know exactly what they need to do to succeed in diet. However, people don't have information about how they exercise, how much and what kind of food they need to eat, how they should deal with their mental problem, such as stress. If people are specifically aware of the information, they will be able to get rid of their fat. 
 First of all, many people who are fat try to work out, but they need to know how much and what kinds of exercise they need to do. Roughly, there are two types of exercise: one is walking or running, and another one is weight lift. Periodical walking or running can be the fastest way to burn the fat, which makes people look ugly. However, it must be longer than 30 minutes because the fat starts burning 30 minutes later after running. Before 30 minutes, carbohydrate, which is main energy source in our body, is consumed. Also, it should be shorter than 60 minutes. After 60 minutes, protein, which consists of muscle, will be consumed. Therefore, to get a perfect result, walking or running between 30 minutes and 60 minutes is the perfect exercise. In addition to running, weight lift is required to burn extra fat because muscle movement supports burning the fat on specific parts of body. Moreover, people can avoid saving fat in our body with getting some muscle.
 To get more successful outcome in diet, food change is demanded. Most obesity is from consuming huge amount of sugar and carbohydrate. People don't recognize how much sugar and carbohydrate they eat usually. Sugar and carbohydrate, which are main energy source for human body, are changed to fat if they are not used. For common men, approximately 1,000~1,200 kcal of carbohydrate is enough. Therefore, people need to calculate food's calories with ingredient lists before they eat. Also, too much fat has to be eliminated on people's food list. Trans-fat is completely unnecessary ingredient, and saturated fat has to be limited to certain amount because both fat works like poison in our body. People must reduce the amount of the food that has much fat, such as French fries, fried chicken, and hamburger if they want to lose their heavy weight.
 Most of all, recently stress has been the primary cause in obesity. When people get stressed, they find ways to remove the stress. The ways can be overeating, and certain kinds of activities that don't use our body because they already feel exhausted, so they don't want to be tired any more through exercises. Overeating definitely causes obesity regardless of what kinds of ingredients food include. In addition, the activities that don't require people to work out only offer people another chance to eat something. Therefore, it is important how people deal with their stress. 
 In conclusion, if people rely on only easier diet skill, can they keep their body healthy? People have avoided the harder way that is related to the main causes that I mentioned above. The solutions should be found in the main causes because the causes tell us the clues about what we should do. There is no permanent alternative instead of exercise and controlling the amount of food that we eat, and the alternative might implicate danger. We can only succeed in diet with the techniques that are connected to the basic causes. 
","Obesity has become one of the major problems in our society. Obesity can cause other physical disease. Even sometimes it is the cause of mental disease. Obviously, obesity threats public health. So, countless people have been trying to remove their obesity with a lot of solutions, such as special exercise machines, particular food or substances, and books that has useful information about diet, but it has not been solved completely. People know exactly what they need to do to succeed in diet. However, people don't have information about how they exercise, how much and what kind of food they need to eat, how they should deal with their mental problem, such as stress. If people are specifically aware of the information, they will be able to get rid of their fat. First of all, many people who are fat try to work out, but they need to know how much and what kinds of exercise they need to do. Roughly, there are two types of exercise: one is walking or running, and another one is weight lift. Periodical walking or running can be the fastest way to burn the fat, which makes people look ugly. However, it must be longer than 30 minutes because the fat starts burning 30 minutes later after running. Before 30 minutes, carbohydrate, which is main energy source in our body, is consumed. Also, it should be shorter than 60 minutes. After 60 minutes, protein, which consists of muscle, will be consumed. Therefore, to get a perfect result, walking or running between 30 minutes and 60 minutes is the perfect exercise. In addition to running, weight lift is required to burn extra fat because muscle movement supports burning the fat on specific parts of body.

One of the unfair things is that some people are suffered from obesity when other people are suffered from starving. Of course, eating food is one of the human wants and most people enjoy their meals. Unfortunately, a human body is willing to store energy by fat even if it is too much to use for maintaining life because there was not enough food in the past. That is why people gain some weight when they eat much. However, people should regulate their weight because obesity generates several problems: being uncomfortable in life, losing self-confidence, and causing disease.

First of all, the obesity makes people hard to move. Imagine that having some heavy things such as five pounds bracelets on your arms and legs. It makes your movement difficult, so you don't want to exercise. As a consequence, you will gain more weight because the fact that people barely exercise remains extra energy, which can be converted to fat. Moreover, because getting fat means the body size is bigger and bigger, it can cause inconvenient situations. For example, when a stout person gets on a crowded bus, the person is having a hard time until he or she finds a suitable seat. 

Second, the people who are fleshy can lose their self-confidence because obesity makes people unattractive as well as uncomfortable. It doesn't mean only skinny people like most celebrities are beautiful. But if people are too fat, other people think they are not attractive anymore. That is the reason that obesity makes people shy. Besides it's not easy to find suitable clothes especially in Korea. When I went to a mall to buy some clothes at first here, I was surprised at so many big clothes. However, in case of Korea, we should find a special shop to buy big clothes. 

The worst problem is obesity can cause some disease such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart attack. As it was revealed before, when people gain much weight, it can give a burden on the knees. Consequently, it occurs arthritis and makes the situation worth because when the arthritis happened once, it's hard to start or continue to work out. Furthermore, it's possible that fat people get diabetes because they have too much sugar to be controlled by insulin, which is one of the hormones in our body. The diabetes makes blood sticky and makes be lost sugar by urine. One of serious disease is heart attack, which can kill people in a short time. If a radius of the artery is getting smaller by some cholesterols and fat, it's difficult for blood to go though there. Finally, when the whole of the artery is blocked, the heart couldn't keep beating because there is no more oxygen, which is necessary for making the heart beat.

It's obvious that obesity does more harm than good. But it doesn't mean that giving up all of delicious things. Even some people try to lose weight by eating disorder. It causes other disease though. Undoubtedly, what people don't take over calories than they need is important, but using extra calories up by exercise is more important. Nowadays, people too busy to make a time to exercise, but they should work out daily to prevent obesity.

The population of the world keeps growing, there are approximately 100 babies are born in every fifteen seconds. Experts predict that in the 2015, the population will become seven billion people in the world, and in the end of the century, there will be 10 billion people in the world. If the population keeps growing, it will push people into a bad situation which is people don't have enough food and water to feed everyone. How can we solve this problem? The three most commonly proposed solutions are education, people growing more food and control the number of the baby be born.

It can solve the problem which is farmers need more labors, and it also can solve the problem which is people do not have enough food. 
 The best solution, then, is control the number of the baby be born. The government has to be very serious about this problem. They need to establish the law such as each family can only has two children. If people have more children, they will get some punishments such as pay many tax. 
 In conclusion, overpopulation is very serious problem in the world, and people have to pay attention on it. If the overpopulation continue keeps growing, people will go into the dangerous.

As the economy develops rapidly, companies try to sell more products and consumers have a strong desire to buy products. At the same time, the overuse of natural resources affects the environment seriously. Global warming will become more common. Hundreds of animals will disappear from Earth because of the industrial pollution all over the world. It is extremely necessary to put the option of recycling on the table. The government, the society and scientists should cooperate and work on three proposed aspects, which are establishing complete policies for industry, providing public recycling activities for people and discovering new technologies for reuse of energy.

First of all, the government can play a very important role in recycling solutions. They can issue several policies to build efficient recycling systems. For example, the government can set up a low tax rate for the recycling and composting companies. It can ask factories to add recycling equipments and control the emission of toxic waste. 

The whole society also needs to organize more practical activities to influence everybody to start recycling. Not only do the media need to provide recycling programs to teach people how to recycle, but the community should also get involved in this campaign. The community can distribute free recycling bins to residents or give incentives to people who do recycle. Unfortunately, it is a long-term campaign to motivate everyone to reduce waste and keep recycling in mind.

Scientists can put their efforts into discovering alternative ways to save natural resources. For instance, using waste materials to produce power can save oil resources. Also, using industrial water for cleaning purposes can preserve natural water. The way we use recycled paper can help save trees. By thinking of other ways to recycle, scientists can help extend the life of Earth.

We need to protect our environment not only for ourselves, but also for plants and animals. If we continue modernizing society at such a rapid rate without thinking about the way we use natural resources, our future generations will not have a green planet. If the government, society and scientists all work together to improve our environment, consider recycling seriously, it will not be too difficult to maintain Earth.

At the same time, the overuse of natural resources affects the environment seriously. Global warming will become more common. Hundreds of animals will disappear from Earth because of the industrial pollution all over the world. It is extremely necessary to put the option of recycling on the table. The government, the society and scientists should cooperate and work on three proposed aspects, which are establishing complete policies for industry, providing public recycling activities for people and discovering new technologies for reuse of energy. First of all, the government can play a very important role in recycling solutions. They can issue several policies to build efficient recycling systems. For example, the government can set up a low tax rate for the recycling and composting companies. It can ask factories to add recycling equipments and control the emission of toxic waste. The whole society also needs to organize more practical activities to influence everybody to start recycling. Not only do the media need to provide recycling programs to teach people how to recycle, but the community should also get involved in this campaign. The community can distribute free recycling bins to residents or give incentives to people who do recycle. Unfortunately, it is a long-term campaign to motivate everyone to reduce waste and keep recycling in mind. Scientists can put their efforts into discovering alternative ways to save natural resources. For instance, using waste materials to produce power can save oil resources. Also, using industrial water for cleaning purposes can preserve natural water. The way we use recycled paper can help save trees. By thinking of other ways to recycle, scientists can help extend the life of Earth. We need to protect our environment not only for ourselves, but also for plants and animals. If we continue modernizing society at such a rapid rate without thinking about the way we use natural resources, our future generations will not have a green planet.

Every opinion is based on beliefs, thinkings or particular interests. The debate has been open from many years ago. As a result, the governments of many countries have restricted with their decrees or laws the researches in this specific area. For instance, the Bush's administration had prohibited to provide federal funds for research. President Bush had not banned the private researches. Thereby, many pharmaceutical companies were researching in this area (Debora, 2009). According to experiments resources, ""the stems cells are unspecialized cells which have the potential to create other types of specific cells, such as blood-, brain-, tissue- or muscle-cells"". These traits have generated several blanks of research with differents aims that has been addressed toward to the study of diseases such as cancer or Alzaheimer. Thus, finantional entities have been pouring billones of dollars into this field. There are two concepts that are controversy related to stem cell research which have been topic of discussion for many people as the use of the knowledge and the method used to acquire theses stem cells.

According to experiments resources many scientists justify the stem cell research since the stem cells can be a solution for many diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzameimer diseases, heart diseases, stroke, diabetes type I, birth defect, spinal cord injury, replace or repair damage organs, reduce risk of transplantation. In the future, humanity could defeat these metabolic disorders or cellular stress with the support of the stem cell research. It could seem like a good strategy to find the correct pathway in the field of the biomedical sciences to resolve the enormous problems in public health and to avoid the surge of the mortality in the population for these illnesses. Albeit, there are many risks in this field because if the results are positives for theses diseases, many people would want to try the humans cloning. Thereby, it would become in a conflict moral, social, and ethic. Perhaps, the stem cell research would be a point to start both civil and worldwide wars. As a result, the destruction of the humanity would be very closer and the world would be socially more chaotic.

A second argument of the scientists is the method to obtain these stem cells. According to Cowan, there are three mechanisms to extract these cells as adult cells, cord cells, and embryonic cells. The area of extraction for adult cells is from bone marrow, for cord cells is from umbilical cord and embryonic cells are extracted from an embryo before of the differentiation of the embryo called blasticyst. According to experiment resources the advantages of this method are the followings:
? """"The benefits of stem cell research have such a great outcome, that it outweighs the ethical issues."" (Cost-benefit-analysis)
? ""If someone is going to have an abortion, isn't it better that we use it for something useful?""
? Adult stem cells would not be that interesting because they do not have the same properties as stem cells from a fetus.
? Another often mentioned advantage is that this research would give great insights about basics of the body.""
However, there are many aspects ethics against this specific method that we can consider as immoral as to kill a whatever human being. The life starts when the embryo is done and insight of this embryo there is a living organism. If scientists want to rescue lives, they cannot kill the life of other people (embryo). They cannot kill the life to rescue other lifes, it does not make sense. Hence, the use of the embryonic stem cells for research implies the destruction of the blastocysts which was formed from the laboratory.

As Phyllips argue, many American scientists think that the United States has been losing money and to find new revenues with this restrictions that were imposed from Bush administration. In contrast, the president Obama abolish the Bush's ruling, authorizing use the federal fund in the stem cell research. Many American scientists exerted pressure to the current administration to allow the participation in these researches and to be more competitive compared with other European groups. Albeit many viewpoints think that stem cell research is a good strategy to find new incomes for the United States, it isn`t justification to slay new living being with this propose.

In conclusion, the stem cell research is a good alternative method to resolve many problems in health since stem cell provide an enormous potential to find effective treatments and the cure for many diseases including cancers, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, Alzheimers, MS, Huntingtons, Parkinsons and more. In addition, the stem cell is a good area for the scientists to learn more about the human growth and cell development. However, there are many moral and ethical implications with this sort of research. Sciences cannot pretend to rescue humans with the sacrifice of other living humans. It is against whatever rational thinking and humanity should not forget the respect for the life. All the living being has the right to live and we cannot acknowledge that one sector of the humanity wants to violate theses principles.

According to Wikipedia:""Health Care refers to the treatment and management of illness, and the preservation of health through services offered by the medical, dental, pharmaceutical, clinical laboratory sciences, nursing, and allied health professions. Health care embraces all the goods and services designed to promote health, including preventive, curative and palliative interventions, whether directed to individuals or to populations.""[1] Obviously, it is super important to everyone, young and old, because you never know when you are going to need it because of an accident, a sudden illness or disease. On average, we now spend more per person on health care than both food and housing, and insurance premiums are multiplying much faster than inflation. In fact, there are millions of people who cannot afford health care due to no job, no health insurance, low income, and high medical costs. Who should supply health care to people? Majority people believe health care should be provided by government. 

Health care should be a right for everyone not a privilege for those who can afford it. Everyone who has/had suffered health trouble has had the same feeling that medical cost is too high to affordable. If only you have good health insurance, you can afford the costs. In other words, if you don't have any health insurance, you had better avoid having any health trouble, because you aren't able to pay the expensive medical costs. Medicare looks like a privilege, and many people don't have right to get it due to not having enough money for the payment. Usually, to get some sick is inevitable for majority people. Does government look on unconcerned about some people who give up the change of cure for no money? Doubtlessly, government ought to have responsibility to take care its country's every legal citizen and resident who needs national non-profit health care not health insurance which is for profit model. Especially now, health care has become more and more increasingly unaffordable for businesses and individuals. The effect is that businesses and individuals are more difficult to choose to keep their health insurance. On top of that, we are tax payer, we have right to get as much value as possible from every dollar of tax we put in. The tax should contribute for health care. So, health care should be provided by government as a human right.

 ""The United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have a universal health care system.""[2] This is doubtless that the U.S. is one of the wealthiest countries, but American do not share the same high honors when it comes to health. What is universal health care? Wikipedia says:""Universal health care is health care coverage for all eligible residents of a political region and often covers medical, dental and mental health care??. Usually some costs are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues.""[3] Wikipedia indicates that from Americas to Asia, from Europe to Australia, a lot of countries, including developed and developing countries, have implemented Universal Health Care.[3] From Universal Health Care system, we can perceive and recognize in the world that is a trend which health care is provided by different country's governments. On the other hand, this is also American people's claim. According to this year May 29 the poll of CNN, there are 62 percent Americans consider the government should guarantee health care for all Americans.[4] 
If government provides health care, medical professionals can concentrate on healing the patient rather than on insurance procedures, and doctors don't have to identify and understand the classes of all the insurance plans. Usually, doctors are often restricted by current health insurance classes, such as doctor will think what tests can be ordered. The compare of the effect of a simplified Universal Health Care system is able to cause doctors, nurses, and other medical professions to simply focus on doing what's best for the patient, and doctor doesn't need to deliberate whether the patient can afford the fee of treatment, as well as patient can receive best treatments. It will be seen from this that having a government health care is very important for a patient, because the government health care can have doctor and patient are both focus on what is best for patient.

Government providing health care would encourage patients to practice medical cure early when treatment will be light. Currently, patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs, especially, many people who are uninsured and those that do have insurance face high deductibles. So, before they decide to go to see a doctor, they will think about costs, and postpone going to see a doctor or might give up seeing a doctor because of the costs. Sometimes, those hesitating can lead to loss the opportunity of the right time of treatment or find some disease in time. Government health care can impel patients to go to see a doctor early, as well as do regular physicals and other preventive measures without any personal economic pressure. 

Things always have two sides. Some people argue that government health care isn't really free since we must pay for it with taxes, because the expenses for health care would have to be paid for with higher taxes. Comparing government health care with rising taxes, which has more important effect on people? Whatever how high taxes are, health care is always a crucial thing in people's lives. People will feel secure due to having sustainable, accessible, and valuable health care. Otherwise, high income people, such as CEOs should have responsibility to pay higher taxes. For those that low income people, no job, and uninsured people, higher taxes will not impact them or affect them less. On the contrary, they can get great benefit from government health care. Raising taxes is not trouble thing that most people need to worry about. 

Because of these substantial reasons, health care Should be Provided by the Government, and all citizens and residents would be covered by this plan and would have equal access to high quality medical care regardless of income level or age. Certainly, health care may be paid for with higher taxes, but health care is an absolute moral necessity and a sustainable people health solution. In addition, health care is provided by government is a great trend in the world. Now, there are many countries have already implemented Universal Health Care system.

Y,,27379,al5,Korean,Male,534,5,w,3597,1,1146,1094,1094,"Military seems like tough work to everybody. Especially, military has been a job for only men in Korea. Even though there are some women soldiers, people who live in Korea don't think they work as men soldiers do. Most Korean guys serve in military from private second class to sergeant, and it is inevitable for Korean men to serve in military. If men choose different courses, such as ROTC and special school for commissioned officer, then they can have higher rank than other men. However, women can choose their serving, which is 2.3% in Korean military, and their rank starts from staff sergeant, which is not just a soldier. They can earn money; usually their salary is higher than $1,200 because it is their job. Also, they can get lots of benefits from government. However, most men serve in military for 2 years as a soldier with considerably low pay, which is less than $100, and they have so hard time, such as violence and getting cursed. Therefore, most Korean guys don't want to serve in military, and some men try to avoid it because of its toughness. Also, men think it is wasting time to serve in military because they can't sustain their jobs, or studying as career. But, after finishing the military service, men don't have any benefits. So, a man who had to serve in Korean army brought in a lawsuit against the unfairness between men and women in military service. There has been a debate about it since the lawsuit happened. Many aspects in military service, such as modern weapon and strategy, have been changed, and now military needs a lot of office works. Moreover, women's rights have improved than before with the ministry of gender equality in Korea. Therefore, women should serve for alternative military work or government organization for a period of time. 
A spokesperson of the ministry of national defense said that women should not serve in military because women have different works called ""pregnancy and birth"". According to the spokes person for the ministry of national defense (2009), ""We need to encourage women pregnant and give birth to babies because only women can be pregnant and give birth to babies and the birth rate has been too low recently"". Logically, it doesn't make any sense. Men can understand the pain that women get over, but their opinion is inappropriate for the debate. Serving in military is constitutional duty. But, pregnancy and birth are not a constitutional duty. It is a choice. Nobody forces women to be pregnant, and make them give birth to babies. They have to declare constitutional ideas about military service. Furthermore, Korea is one of the countries that have the lowest birth rate, which is ironic. Many women in Korea tend not to be pregnant or have babies. If the ministry of national defense wants to compare pregnancy and birth with military service, birth rate should be the highest in the world. So, the point of the ministry of national defense is not logical.
According to the spokesperson of the ministry of national defense (2009), military has to focus on its purpose. Military doesn't have to care about equality in democracy. The ministry of national defense's opinion is that men's serving in military is much better in terms of physical difference between men and women and effectiveness. That was true in 1960s. In 1960s in Korea, which was right after the Korean War, Korea and, Korean military system was poor, and Korea didn't have modern weapons. After Korea was industrialized and developed with some countries support, especially the United States, Korea has built lots of military organization everywhere. Also, Korea has developed and imported innumerable modern weapons. Therefore, aspects of battle have been completely different from 1960s whereas North Korea still has the same weapons and system that they had in 1960s. So women don't have to participate in a battle anymore because there are many works to do without personal weapons, and it doesn't need considerable stamina. Women military officers usually say that ""A missile button doesn't discriminate against gender"". In addition, there are several industries that are related to military service. So, women can work for the military industries as an alternative. Also, working for a government organization can be an alternative. 
There is still discrimination in work. Our society has not achieved perfect practical equality. Even though the ministry of gender equality has suggested some policies for women and some of them have been accepted, it is hard to get rid of all discrimination. Mostly, men have higher position in an organization, and their salaries are more than women's. According to Gender Empowerment Measures (2007), Korea is 64th out of 93rd. Also, even if both husbands and wives have a job, wives do more house work, and taking care of babies is wives' work. Furthermore, there are some stereotypes that are common Asian women. Women are supposed to be perfect morally, and are supposed to behave carefully. If women make some mistakes that men can make, and it is related to sexual issue, women can get more cursed morally. So, unless the discrimination is solved completely, it is excessive demand for women to make them serve in military in terms of practical equality.
In conclusion, men have not gotten some benefits from serving in military. It seems like they just have volunteered for government and citizens. Now, men are complaining about their duty. Nobody had thought that women should take the same duty as men do before women started to go into society. However, women's characteristic has changed, and they are actively participating in our society. So, men and women's opinions about their characteristics have been modified through industrialization and globalization. We can easily see women leaders on TV, and they work better than men. It inspires women in the world, and there will be more women leader or worker in Korea in response to the world's changes. But, some studies, such as GEM, tell us that women still don't have the same equality as men, and it cannot be solved until all men quit their jobs. So, it is unreasonable for women to serve in military. To get equality and solve the debate on unfairness in military, women need to serve in public organizations, or some companies that are related to military as an intern. So, they can gain experience before they go into society. As Korea changes, the solution might need to be changed. Whatever the solution is, the solution should include and handle with both sides opinions. 

","Military seems like tough work to everybody. Especially, military has been a job for only men in Korea. Even though there are some women soldiers, people who live in Korea don't think they work as men soldiers do. Most Korean guys serve in military from private second class to sergeant, and it is inevitable for Korean men to serve in military. If men choose different courses, such as ROTC and special school for commissioned officer, then they can have higher rank than other men. However, women can choose their serving, which is 2.3% in Korean military, and their rank starts from staff sergeant, which is not just a soldier. They can earn money; usually their salary is higher than $1,200 because it is their job. Also, they can get lots of benefits from government. However, most men serve in military for 2 years as a soldier with considerably low pay, which is less than $100, and they have so hard time, such as violence and getting cursed. Therefore, most Korean guys don't want to serve in military, and some men try to avoid it because of its toughness. Also, men think it is wasting time to serve in military because they can't sustain their jobs, or studying as career. But, after finishing the military service, men don't have any benefits. So, a man who had to serve in Korean army brought in a lawsuit against the unfairness between men and women in military service. There has been a debate about it since the lawsuit happened. Many aspects in military service, such as modern weapon and strategy, have been changed, and now military needs a lot of office works. Moreover, women's rights have improved than before with the ministry of gender equality in Korea. Therefore, women should serve for alternative military work or government organization for a period of time.

Y,,27391,gb4,Chinese,Female,534,5,w,3597,1,1179,1070,1078,"For many house wives, life is an endless cycle of household chores. No matter how much they do everyday, there is still a lot to do for the next day. Though the situation are improving with man's helping out at home today, some studies show that women continue to do the major household chores,and many men still consciously or unconsciously look on housework as ""woman's work"". However, more and more women become active, self-supporting in the society, some of them have to have jobs or run businesses for earn a living ,that means they have to spend more time on work, less time at home to do housework. A man as a husband has duty to help his wife to share housework , take care of children. All these participation are really necessary and important for making a good marriage relationship. 


Husbands should do more housework because it is a way to show appreciation for their wives.Time has changed,the modern man is not shy to do woman's work and in fact these days men can cook and clean as well as any woman can. There is no line of demarcation anymore between a man's work and a woman's work. They will have much happier, healthier and content wives if they join in the housework.Through sharing the housework , they not only will understand of how woman's housework is hard like outside work, but also will both be able to relax in the evenings together with all the housework out of the work, then spend more time to do other things or play with their children.""When a man does housework, it feels to the woman like an expression of caring and concern, which then physically reduces her stress,"" says Joshua Coleman, a San Francisco-area psychologist (Dr. Coleman, Joshua. The Lazy Husband. London: Piaktus Books Ltd, 2005.) On the other hand, if husbands don't help their wives who are busy and have to take care of babies too to do a little housework ,highly-stressed wives often suffer from fatigue, frustration and anger ? all ill feelings that can affect their relationships with their spouses and kids. Overall men who help around the house are happier, have successful marriages. 


In addition, women can make money and raise a family now, why shouldn't men share their wives' housework? Actually,women are becoming active working class members of society which means they are out of home for longer hours than they used to. This leads to an automatic sharing of household chores between men and women. Because the economic situation today has affected families significantly, women also earn a crust , still give birth and carry out household chores. Men have to accept these facts! In a situation that both husband and wife work outside the home time management might become an issue. If men cooperate with wives at home then they will discover they make a great team, and they are not just roles as husbands, are real supporters of their wives.So chores can be completed quicker when the husband involve in sharing housework. Since many couples are both working or have careers, it is only fair that both would help each other with the house chores and the kids. For example,if the husband is not expected to be the only or even the primary breadwinner to the family, so that his wife have a full-time job. It is not reasonable to expect her to do all of the child care, grocery shopping, cooking, laundry, and cleaning in the home. With more and more women entering the workforce to build careers, husbands now need to step up and help with the general housework which is required to keep most homes operating efficiently. Today, many women actually are the larger wage earner in the home. The role of the husband is changing dramatically.


Also, husbands that do housework can provide quality modeling to their children. Parents often want their children to be involved in housework themselves, and it is easier to expect from children when the work is actually performed by both spouses.""It can also communicate to children that on some level, housework is just work and everyone needs to get involved.""as Todd Pheifer says. They will be a good example to the children by doing more housework, especially to the boys who will also learn how to keep a house tidy and organized. This should be called kind of education. They should show their children what the harmonious family is with helping each other, so children would learn somewhat they shall do at home if they were married. This is especially significant if couples have sons.Otherwise, if they see their mothers doing everything, they will likely expect the same things from their wives. Some women don't pay attention to offer chances to their husband and children. Remember that there will also be unexpected and emergency times during the marriage that the husband actually must take over all household tasks,such as arrival of a new baby, the wife's illness, the wife must be away from home for a while, moving to a new family home and other circumstances. They often require the husband to share or completely take over housework until things settle down .Depending on the father's expression in those cases, the children will have good or bad experiences about how to handle housework without mom's helping hands.


Men can learn house chores quite easily. The only problem is that many men have been conditioned not to do ""woman's work."" Even some men say ""We are men, made to hunt, made from sterner stuff. Ours is the job of protecting, surviving and of course ruling aristocratically."" In some countries,the traditional concepts are still obstinate that ""men make houses,women make homes""or ""Men tend to work more outside the home, while women take on more of the household labor."" (Science Daily, Apr. 8, 2008) These kinds of views probably are not very wrong, but according to above reasons, Obviously, that the husband has responsibility to do housework is not just for his wife, sharing housework is also an important element to maintain a love family.

In conclusion,marriage is a matter of cooperation. Housework is something that a man and a woman should take pride in. It is the general upkeep of the house that they call home.

Obligatory national service is crucial and required in many countries today. Even though there are the different policies about this in different countries, people do still have the responsibility to do a period of national service at some time in their lives for reinforcing country's military, and make young generation keep practicing the skills which protect their countries.

Most of people who go to military are university students. Many students suffer from the gap between their educations. While they are away from the school for two years, many things change academically. New theories come out and new techniques get developed. When students come back to school they have to work extra hard to make up for their lost periods. Besides, many students claim they don't remember most of what they learned before they went to the military. That's also a great deal of loss.

Government imposed many taxes on tobacco to make people stop smoking, but people still buy tobacco as many as they bought before even though tobacco became so expensive.

 First of all, tobacco can be serious causes of diseases. Specifically, the diseases can be a cancer on lung and throat, Countless people are died by smoking tobacco. Doctors attribute the cause of dieing to smoking tobacco, and they encourage people to stop smoking, but it is extremely hard to stop it after people start to smoke it.

 In connection with personal health, tobacco threats public health. People used to smoke in public places, such as restaurants and park. People are not allowed to smoke in certain places, but they can still smoke in different places that are public. People can smoke in bars even though there are many non-smokers. Also, some restaurants allow guests to smoke. Furthermore, if there are some people who are older than others and smokers, older people ask younger people if they can smoke. Koreans really care about their age, so if someone who is old wants to do something, younger people socially need to accept it. Non-smokers' health should be more considered than smoker's desire.

After that i began reading partitures and played small songs for my level, it was very funny, and i enjoyed going to my classes every day.
He had a lot of patience with me, and he let me make mistakes when i was playing but after i was done my song he corrected my mistakes and i started the song from the beginig. I began to improve my skills, and week after week i learned a new classical song. He got me to play songs that i didn't think i could play.

 From the beginning of the human history, women always play a significant role in the community. In early society, females were the symbol of life because they need to bear children and rear them. This is also why the earth is called ""mother"" due to its unique characteristic, living begins. The role of women has been changed since the change of society. There are many factors that may affect the role of females in the society. The important factors are economy, education, and the rise of general position in the society. 
 Before women were housewives. They start to be involved in manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution. Many industries were growing fast, and they need more people to participate in the market. Thus women could work and make money and then they could live by themselves without men. Economic independent is the important cause. For example, in traditional Taiwan society, women must help their husband or family, they couldn't or didn't need to work. During world economy style was changed, one salary is not enough, some families need double-income to support their household expenses. Men and women changed their family role that is normal now.
 Education is the reason of women could change easy. In the past, most women were illiteracy because their parents just support men to study without women. If a few women have chance to learn, they couldn't go to school and only educated at home. Along with economy booming, women are capable of accept education, even high levels. According to a Taiwanese report, in the university, 60 percent of women have had the Master degree. Furthermore, education changed the work form, women can do any job, such as pilots, politicians or grand justices.
 The most important factor is the rise of general position in the society. Until recent decades, women are tending to be treated fairly on job offers thus many females can acquire higher positions, such as managers, CEOs, etc. One of the most successful females is Carly Fiorina who was CEO in Hewlett-Packard. Before she became the CEO, she didn't understand the industry .She faced the challenge and then she led Hewlett-Packard to become the one of successful company in the world.
 In conclusion, although some area of women still face the unequal treatment by religion or social culture. However, the most of women have changed the role in her life. They can go to school and work, even occupy the significant position like a president. Until now America has never had a female president. How about breaking the tradition?

 First, I want to talk about a real story about myself. 23 years ago, when my mother was pregnant, everyone who saw my mother said:"" The baby must be a boy."" So my parents thought I must be a boy. But at last, the doctor said to my father:"" Congratulations, it's a girl."" My father was so surprised and upset that he said nothing for there minutes. From my father's reaction, we can know in China, people prefer boys to girls. But in recent years, this idea has changed a lot. Nowdays, people treat girls equally. The role of women is changing from several aspects such as women's work, women's education and women's daily life.
 First, there are many changing of women's role in work.. Long long ago, women were not permitted to work outside .If women wanted to work outside or wanted to make money in ancient time, people would treat women strange and thought they did not obey women's rules. But it changed a lot in nowdays. Most of women can work outside whether their husbands can earn much money or not. The purpose of women's working outside is not only to make money but also to prove that women can d everything as men. So, today you see many female are very professinal in their research field, such as academic field or in government. Also, there are much female leaders in enterprise today. All of these show the changing role of women in work.
 Second, there are many changes of women's role in education. In the past, because of many reasons, most of frills could not go to school for study. There is an old saying in China:"" It's best for women to have no knowledge."" So, because of this old and stupid idea, girls could not go to school. There are also some other reasons such as economic reasons. But, it really changed a lot today. The number of female in the university is the same as the number of male today. We can't image it in the past. Also, more and more women go abroad for study. For me, when I said I wanted to study the states, my parents supported me immediately. So, from all of these, we can see 
the changing role of women in study.
 Third, there are many changes of women's role in daily life. In the past, people thought it's women's resbonsbility and duty to do all housework. If women can't cook delicious food and clean the house, all people would thought it's the biggest failure of being women. Therefore, we can image women in the past must be very busy and tired. Fortunately, nowdays, people change this old idea. At home, husbands would help their wives to do housework. Even today, some husbands get costurmed to do housework at home and their wives work outside.
 In conclution, the role of women has changed a lot today. Women can work outside, study as they want and there are a lot of changes in daily life. These are because economic and other reasons. I predict , there must be more changes of role of women.

Third, there are many changes of women's role in daily life. In the past, people thought it's women's resbonsbility and duty to do all housework. If women can't cook delicious food and clean the house, all people would thought it's the biggest failure of being women. Therefore, we can image women in the past must be very busy and tired. Fortunately, nowdays, people change this old idea. At home, husbands would help their wives to do housework. Even today, some husbands get costurmed to do housework at home and their wives work outside. In conclution, the role of women has changed a lot today. Women can work outside, study as they want and there are a lot of changes in daily life. These are because economic and other reasons. I predict , there must be more changes of role of women.","First, I want to talk about a real story about myself. 23 years ago, when my mother was pregnant, everyone who saw my mother said:"" The baby must be a boy."" So my parents thought I must be a boy. But at last, the doctor said to my father:"" Congratulations, it's a girl."" My father was so surprised and upset that he said nothing for there minutes. From my father's reaction, we can know in China, people prefer boys to girls. But in recent years, this idea has changed a lot. Nowdays, people treat girls equally. The role of women is changing from several aspects such as women's work, women's education and women's daily life. First, there are many changing of women's role in work. Long long ago, women were not permitted to work outside. If women wanted to work outside or wanted to make money in ancient time, people would treat women strange and thought they did not obey women's rules. But it changed a lot in nowdays. Most of women can work outside whether their husbands can earn much money or not. The purpose of women's working outside is not only to make money but also to prove that women can d everything as men. So, today you see many female are very professinal in their research field, such as academic field or in government. Also, there are much female leaders in enterprise today. All of these show the changing role of women in work. Second, there are many changes of women's role in education. In the past, because of many reasons, most of frills could not go to school for study. There is an old saying in China:"" It's best for women to have no knowledge."" So, because of this old and stupid idea, girls could not go to school. There are also some other reasons such as economic reasons. But, it really changed a lot today. The number of female in the university is the same as the number of male today. We can't image it in the past. Also, more and more women go abroad for study. For me, when I said I wanted to study the states, my parents supported me immediately. So, from all of these, we can see the changing role of women in study.

 The earth is organized six continent and five oceans. The continents have been moving slowly. When they clash each other continent, they make an earthquake. The influence of earthquake id huge and it bring a lot of problems.
 First is makes tsunami. In these days. You often hear about tsunami. It is made by earthquake. When is occurs, in ocean, it makes a huge crevice and a lot of water go through the crevice and the water go out from the crevice. As a result, it makes a huge wave. So this wave is tsunami
 Second an earthquake makes many victims. It can predict, if you are the GOD. So we can not predict against earthquake. For example, one weak ago, Samoa has a tsunami and Indonesia has a earthquake. But nobody knew before they have a tsunami and earthquake. As a result, it made many victims.
 Last of all, it damages economy of country which have earthquake. When they have an earthquake, many factories, buildings, houses and load are broken. So if they want to return to the former condition, they have to spend a lot of time and money. It is so difficult.

 When I get up in the morning, I turn on my laptop and play jazz music. After I take a shower, I dress myself and take my MP3 player with huge headphone. While heading to school, I listen to rock music. At the lunch time, I go to cafeteria with friends to have lunch and I can hear pop music from big speakers. After I'm done with classes, I go to Starbucks and also hear jazz music from the speaker. I don't think my life cycle is not that different from your daily life. Everyday people like us hear music from everywhere. From infants to adolescents and adults, we have no choice but to be influenced by great power of the music on our lives. 

 Because my mom loves classical and jazz music, I have listened to music since I was in her womb. Not only my mom but almost every mom listens to classical music because listening to classical music is said to have a good effect on their little children. A recent research suggests that classical music let children have a sense of rhythm and pitch, an ear for music, and power of concentration. 

 For me, I got influenced so much from the music when I was a teenager. I was easily moved by lyrics and tones. The reason why I easily took comfort from music is that I needed an escape from the stress and lyrics exactly know how I feel. Like my case, it is considered common sense that adolescence is the most emotional period. It is not too much say that personal identity is built up when he or she is adolescents. That is to say music has a big power of influence especially to adolescents.

 What about adults? Actually, the influence of the music is also huge for adults. Adults are living in the flood of stress such as the stress from the boss, a lack of money, or a pressure of life. So music would help soothe their nerves as a work song. Sometimes it goes so far as to give the reason why they live. 

 As I have shown, although the influence of the music cannot be easily come to the front, music has enormous power on our lives. During my life, I got a great deal of influence from the music without awareness. At this point, I cannot say music is just music but I would say music is a big part of our lives.","When I get up in the morning, I turn on my laptop and play jazz music.

As technology has developed and has been invented, there are lots of media in the world. Therefore, media is a very important part of living in modern society. For example, in my grandfather's generation, there is not cellular phone; however, in my generation, there are cellular phone which has various functions and designs. This cellular phone affect many parts of our living because people can contact other people in anywhere with their cellular phone. However, any media affects to every generation positively but also negatively.
 Today's children, compared with older generation, were affected by various media positively and negatively. As there are lots of inventions, time which children spend with media increase more than past. For example, most of children watch TV which is included mass media. Children can get information or just enjoy and relieve their stress through the television. When children watch news channel like CNN or some channel related with education, they can get some news and knowledge easily. However, children can get negative influences since there is not limitation of contacting with mass media. Nowadays, since most of mass media consider industry parts, there are lots of unsound scenes. Therefore, children who are not maturer can imitate the unsound behavior by watching TV. Like this, media have both positive role and negative role to children.
 To adult in modern society, dependent of media is increasing as there are lots of inventions. According to a recently released survey by Korean National Research Center, more than two third surveyed adult mentioned that when they work they usually use media. Also, they said that if they cannot use any media, it is hard to work in modern society since when adults get information; they use television or news paper or internet, etc. Also, they use media when they not only work but also enjoy life. Today, as lots of entertainments are developed, many adults spend their spare time with media. 
 To old age, media give both convenience and inconvenience. For example, my grandfather who has not healthy body spends most of his time to watch television. Through television and radio, he can know the situation of world and feel fun without boring. Also, sometimes, he use internet to contact other people or to play game. However, since technology is often developed and invented, it is hard old people like my grandfather to catch the speed which technology is developed and invented. Therefore, some old age feel a sense of alienation. 
 In conclusion, as technology is developed and invented, there are lots of media which affect all of generation positively and negatively. This media account for most of important parts to living in modern society.

Earthquakes are natural phenomena that have been causing disasters in many countries where impact them. In recent years, Asian countries have been most affected; they are more prone to earthquakes for various reasons geological and volcanic eruptions. The impact of earthquakes can affect mainly on: the death of people, destruction of entire cities and the economy's down, causing negative effects on the future of society.

The death of people is the most terrible effect that earthquakes can cause. They occurred in seconds and people don't have chance to prepare for defense against it. When persons death, affect directly the feelings and emotions of them, making a terrible situation in the population. Furthermore, people still live in the city affected, try to rescue their families, friends, and neighbors, also eventually died.

The earthquakes affect directly in the destruction of entire cities. They are strong and destroy most of all the infrastructure of the cities. In some cases, it can destroy buildings, hospitals, houses, universities, buses, cars, streets, and highways, affecting all material things possible. All of these natural disasters make very difficult the rescue of persons. Help usually is required of other cities, even other countries, as soon as possible, some helps send helicopters, ambulances, food or everything that is helpful. 

After that earthquakes happen in the cities, only awaiting a desert city, where you will find everything totally destroyed and over. Many people die, infrastructure has been damaged, the shops are closed, schools and universities there are no classes, businesses are stops, all this results in that the economy down. These natural disasters affect the economy severely, because cities must recover and rebuild everything to function normally.

In conclusion, earthquakes are natural disasters that have affected many countries in the world. They occur with different intensity and damage, some strongly and others without causing damage. These natural disasters occur without anyone expected, but in my opinion, people should try to have expectations at home to be prepared for any natural disaster.

It was exhausting because in this point, where the 3 rivers joint each other, waves are higher and more frequent. However, we both thrive under pressure so we got to the other bank.

2008 is a very special year for China because in 2008 China held the Beijing Olympic Games. It is a so exciting thing for all the Chinese people. As you know, we had the dream of holding Olympic Games for more that 100 years. Also we applied for the 2000 Olympic game .But because of many reasons we lost. All of the people of my country felt sad at that time. But we never gave up .At last we got the chance to hold 2008 Olympic game. So, this has much affects on my country. It made more foreigners from all over the world know China and stimulated China's economy, also more Chinese people feel more pride of our country.
First, 2008 Beijing Olympic Games made the world know more about China. Before it, maybe some people had misunderstanding of today's China's suiation. They may thought China was the same as 100 years ago . During Beijing Olympic Games, people from all over the world came to Beijing. They saw and experienced much during they stayed at Beijing. Also the beautiful Olympic buildings attracted them. Foreigners may also felt culture of Beijing by themselves and I think these experiences let them know today's China is so different that they will become more interested in China's culture and history. This gives more opportunities for China to get involved in the world. Of course, more foreigners are learning Chinese now. 
Second, obviously Beijing Olympic Games stimulated China's economy. Because many visitors came to Beijing during hat time and they consumed a lot. So this is stimulated China's economy. The Olympic Games have created 1.8 million new jobs across all the industries, of which more than 370,000 posts were created in 2008. According to experts' predictions, from 2004 to 2008, the Beijing Olympic Games contributed 105.5 billion yuan (13.4 billion US dollars) to Beijing's GDP. Therefore, China's economy benefited much from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
Third, Chinese people felt more pride of our country after the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Before, because of many reasons, some of Chinese people sometimes had many disagreements with government's policies. They sometimes felt disappoint of China. While after the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games Chinese people have seen government's hard work and their abilities. So, they are confident of China again now, This confidence made them work more hard because they think they should attribute themselves for our great country.
In conclusion, the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games have many affects on China. The 2008 Beijing Olympic Games not only effect on China's economy but also effect on foreigners' opinions of China. So, this is a seminal event of China.

Following the economy style is changed that unemployment is spreading to the world. It is a global economic issue. In Taiwan or America, unemployment rate is fast growing each year. There are many causes lead to unemployment. First, the issue of cost, many factories was moved to the low cost areas for cheap natural and human resources. Second, the death of company, America car industry is depressed, thus many people lost jobs. Unemployment is the most serious problem now. For the issue, we must to fact the effects, such as family, society and economic.
 The first effect for the unemployment is family fight. No job means no societal ability, no target of life and the damage the pride. For family, salary is the source of family expense. If they don't have money to buy food, go to a doctor or accept education. The balance of family will be break. In China, it is often said that "" Poverty and humbleness forever bring miseries to marriage."" Because of the pressure of no money, the problems of family violence and divorce are happened often. In Taiwan, every day have suicide news for unemployment.
 Another effect for the unemployment is society problem. It is speedily growing the crime rate in economic depression. There are varying crime act that types of range from burglary to kidnap. And the suicidal problems are getting serious now. It's not just personal suicide. Many kids are the victims in this case.
 A third effect for the unemployment is economic state. It's not fair in fortune. The whole world has 90% money to grasp in 1% man. No job, it will become homeless because they don't have money to pay loan; we will not go to a doctor because we don't have money to pay insurance, but most of richer can easy to spend money or make much money. It is unbalanced of the money distribution. On the other side, some boss use the unemployment and then increase the work time and reduce the salary.
 Surely, many countries start to solve the unemployment. The government invests the massive funds to help the economy and creates more jobs. If the economy environment is improved and the effect of unemployment will be reduce.

Korea face population problem which is decrease of population, becoming aging society and concentration in urban area. Also, those problems cause many effects.
First of all, to explain about the cause of population problem, today, in my country, Korea, population decreases than past. In past, most people prefer boy than girl when they are pregnant. Therefore, some people had abortion since the baby was not boy. Furthermore, in 1980, government had a policy which reduces children because of economy. Also, as increasing opportunity women to learn, the woman who works are also increased. However, since there are unfair treatments to pregnant women in their working place, many women don't prefer having baby. Like above reasons, population become decreasing and Korea faced serious problem.
According to a research by UN, Korea is becoming ageing society since in 2000 as population is decreased. This change of population affects economy aspect. First, there are not enough people to have a charge of producing part. Also, the people who are consumer are decreased. Then, as the population which should depend on supporting increase, financial state will be put hard. It can bring a shortage of labor and lose revitalization of economy. 
Furthermore, population concentrates on urban area since most people prefer to live in urban area. This preference has some problems. One thing is traffic jam. As there is a serious traffic jam, the time which people spend on the road is increased. This also influences the air pollution. Also, there are no place all of people to live in urban area while rural area has extra space. As people move to city, there are not people to agriculture in farm. 
 In conclusion, there is a population problem in my country, Korea. This population have many results negatively.

 In Korea, the number of a divorce increases in modern days. Of course, there were some divorces in the past. But most of those were special case, and people looked divorces that are unconditionally bad things. People didn't try to understand divorced couple. On the other hands, nowadays, a lot of divorces make people change their perspective, and the view of people makes more divorces. Now, unfortunately a divorce rate of Korea reach in third place in the world. Why is the divorce of Korea serious like this? The reasons of the divorce can be individual problems, but the increase of divorce isn't affected of just individual reasons. Important causes of the increase are an individual society, a working mom and a mammonism.
 First, an individual society affects the divorce. Long times ago, people think that a communal society is important. Most family is a big family. They farm together by a cooperation. They need to have many family because each family is worker. But nowadays, people think that an individual is more important than communal society, because modern society isn't agriculture society. They don't need to have many family and think that it is important to success in their own job. So, they think themselves more than their family. As a result, many people decide to divorce easily.
 Second, a working mom affects the divorce. In old days, people have a stereotype that is all female must do housekeeping and take care of sons and daughters. If they has a job, they quit the job after they marry. It was a traditional mind of Korea. On the other hands, In modern society, even though many mothers of Korea have a job, they are keeping the job. Some women can quit their job, but it is just up to their choice. Most women work in their workplace, do housekeeping and take care of their children. They are struggling to keep their all responsibility. But finally, they are to be tired and be under stress, and they have a family trouble easily. For this reason, many couple reach to divorce.
 Third, mammonism-the greedy pursuit of riches- affects the divorce. The country is developing, and money is to be important thing for people. In modern society, people can be hard to live without money. It is right money is of the essence in the world, but some people think money is the whole in the world and can do anything even if the thing is very bad and wrong. Some bad women marry with rich man for get money. They love just his money, not him. Shortly after, they want divorce for getting alimony although they don't say ""give me the money"" directly. Nowadays, such women are increasing, and they serve to increased divorce.
 The divorce is relevant to that caused by changing society as above, therefore we cannot say it is just individual problem. It should be said that is social problem. Exactly, the reason is social problem, too. Increased divorce is natural in todays, but an important thing is not to make the divorce bigger social problem.

 The Korea birth rate has fallen at 1.13 per a woman in 2007. It is below the minimum birth rate, 2.1, to maintain social structure of population. The Korea government has provided the public advertisement to increase the birth rate more than this minimum rate and one-time incentive when a woman has a third child in her family. Ironically, the government had had the campaign to decrease the birthrate to one or two children per family in 1970s. However, the situation of birth rate turned into the opposite way within 30 years. In spite of efforts of the Korean government, the birth rate is not increasing anymore. Low birthrate has had several important causes, such as increasing the number of professional women, expensiveness of childcare cost, changing people's value.
 First, as increasing the number of professional women, the women become too busy to make babies. In Korea, more than one-third couples are working together for a living. One forth of professional area is occupied by women. For this reason, women's social impact is increased, but at the same time, their impact on the family is decreased. Because of the expectation to women at work is the same as that of men, professional women must become a super women to combine work and family. In this situation, women might think that one child will be the best choice for them to manage two roles as the working woman and mom. 
 Next, financial burden to childcare might be the one of the reasons of low birth rate. The average time from birth to independence from parents will be 25 years or more in Korea. It means that the parents have the responsibility to take care of their children at least for 25 years. Since the average cost for bring up children per child is $290,000 until a child becomes 18 years old in the United States, the expenses will be much more than this amount in Korea. The childcare cost in Korea mainly includes education, living expenses, and financial support for children's wedding. Especially, the cost for education is the greatest burden to their parents. Because many Korean parents have very high aspiration of education, they spend a lot of money for education. In average, young children in Korea should go to private academies at least 3 or 4. Therefore, the cost of private education is often beyond the average parent's ability to pay. Korean parents often reach the conclusion that they want only one child.
 Finally, the birth rate can be influenced by changing of people's value about the relationship between their life and their children. Many women are unwilling to interrupt their life or careers by having babies. The new term ""DINK"" well describes this phenomenon. DINK stands for Double Income No Kids and means ""a high-earning couple who chooses not to have children and is therefore able to afford a more expensive consumer lifestyle than those with families (Wikipedia)"". Young generation in Korea pursue DINK lifestyle. In addition, since many newly married couples do not want to give up their life style enjoyed without children, they delay to have a baby or want only one child.
 In conclusion, as the low birth rate in Koran breaks new low record, Korean should overcome this problem within near future to maintain the social structure. Increased number of professional women, high cost of taking care of children, and changes of people's value lead to this phenomenon. The practical solutions for this problem should be suggested.","The Korea birth rate has fallen at 1.13 per a woman in 2007.

The FARC, revolutionary armed forces of Colombia in Spanish, are a guerrilla movement that was created in the 1960 in Colombia. Initially, their purpose was to install a communist regime in Colombia but their goal changed with time and they started to cultivate cocaine and drugs in different areas, using this ""industry"" to finance their organization and purchase weapons. With time the drug business was more and more lucrative for them, consequently they grew in more areas of Colombia. The guerilla is a significant problem to Colombians and it is the cause for many sad problems in my country such as violence, kidnapping, and drugs. 


First of all, the FARC is the main generator of violence in Colombia. They used to kill or force innocent people in rural areas to leave their farms and use this territory to grow cocaine plants. When the people were forced to leave their homes in rural areas, it was usually people that had owned the land for many years. This people, who initially had a normal lifestyle, using the farms to cultivate fruits or vegetables, were forced into poverty. The guerilla used to arrive to the farms suddenly with weapons and force the people to leave their place many times only with what they had on. This people would lose everything, including their opportunities and they would have no other choice than to leave the towns and migrate to a bigger city without money or home, without nothing!. If the people didn't want to leave their territory the Guerilla would intimidate and even kill some people and in some cases violate the woman and occasionally they killed entire families! They also did terrorist attacks in some cities and towns, consequently they injured people, soldiers, children, and infrastructure.


The guerilla also started to kidnap for financing. The would initially ask money to people with resources, so they would have to pay significant ransoms and if they denied to pay the guerilla kidnapped one member of the family. It didn't matter if they were children, old, or sick people. The guerilla took the people to the jungle, without healthcare or food, without a place to live and they would treat this people very poorly until the family paid the money. Some families went into bankruptcy because they were asked to pay big amounts of money. Then the guerilla stared to kidnap politics, they said that they would do a humanitarian interchange but this has also been a lie. Fortunately all the violence and kidnapping has changed in the past 8 years with the current president who has changed many of this by making the government reach all this areas and make the guerrillas go deep into the jungle. 


With respect to the drugs, they cultivate cocaine in the jungle and they use that to obtain money. As a result they buy more weapons to kill innocent people, kidnap and do violent things. They export the drugs to Europe and the United States and this money also contributes greatly to the violence, and our government has worked very hard to extinguish the cocaine plantations and many good people have died trying to stop this. Obviously they obtain big money with this business, and they still take farms of innocent people and they become more rich, and the poor people become more poor. For me and for all Colombians this doesn't make any sense. 


There are various consequences of the FARC presence in my country. With our current president, Alvaro Uribe all of this has been improving, and now we can travel in my country without fear, and the number of displaced people is decreasing, and the terrorist attacks have decreased. On the other hand, the guerilla has gone to many other countries to explain their politics, and some people even believe in them! But the foreign people don't know how many tears have been shed by the acts of the guerilla in Colombia. It is a sad story, because my country is very beautiful, and full of many good people, smart and good workers. So if one day you hear about Colombia and bad news, don't think that all people are drug dealers, or bad people, the good people are many more. Everyone who goes to Colombia always wants to stay or come back, because people are very friendly, and my country is the most beautiful, lovely and best country in the world.
","The FARC, revolutionary armed forces of Colombia in Spanish, are a guerrilla movement that was created in the 1960 in Colombia. Initially, their purpose was to install a communist regime in Colombia but their goal changed with time and they started to cultivate cocaine and drugs in different areas, using this ""industry"" to finance their organization and purchase weapons. With time the drug business was more and more lucrative for them, consequently they grew in more areas of Colombia. The guerilla is a significant problem to Colombians and it is the cause for many sad problems in my country such as violence, kidnapping, and drugs. First of all, the FARC is the main generator of violence in Colombia. They used to kill or force innocent people in rural areas to leave their farms and use this territory to grow cocaine plants. When the people were forced to leave their homes in rural areas, it was usually people that had owned the land for many years. This people, who initially had a normal lifestyle, using the farms to cultivate fruits or vegetables, were forced into poverty. The guerilla used to arrive to the farms suddenly with weapons and force the people to leave their place many times only with what they had on.

Venezuela is a country, which has lot natural resources such as oil, gas and sea, but we did not have a good political system. For many years, we have had different presidents and everything is equal, a country with many problems and just some people receiving good benefits. In recently years, we elected Hugo Chavez how our president, many believed him, like someone that could change Venezuela in a better country. He had   excellent ideas of how improve a country that was deep bad. Actually, Venezuela has many social problems in areas such as security, health care and poverty.

First of all, insecurity is the main problem for Venezuelan people; the main cause of this problem is the difference social between persons, a lot of people never have received education. On other hand, The Venezuelan judicial system, this badly damaged, there is much corruption in the country. Another cause of insecurity in the country is that the police need more efficient methods, new weapons, new patrol cars, and so they could work better.

Other social problems of Venezuela, is the healthcare. First of all, hospitals are damaged, the government has not invested enough to supply medicines, beds, medical equipment and everything needed to function correctly. Also, doctors are not receiving a monthly salary appropriate; as they should receive for a job they spend considerable time and saving lives. The private clinics, they have good doctors, equipment and facilities but are very expensive, this leads to a great social problem in the country, the government cannot solve.

Finally and most powerful social problem in Venezuela, is poverty. It has been several presidents; some more good than others, but in the end people still live in poverty. One of the main reasons is that people have not studied at university after completing high school; many begin to work and forget their studies. On the other hand, there is much unemployment in the country because the government does not encourage private enterprise to create more jobs.

In conclusion, there are many causes of social problems in Venezuela have deteriorated some as insecurity, health care, and others have improved a little, like poverty, because the price of oil has remained fairly high in recent years. It is important to mention that Venezuela, could be an economic world power, this is achieved by using natural resources to benefit the country and helping people.

First of all, the climate can determine the things a person buys. Weather is the short term changes in temperature while climate is the long term changes. Therefore, a person who expects frequent sunny days and blue skies should not expect those in a place with a cold climate. A person who lives in a warm climate probably does not have to worry about buying many winter coats, hand warmers, or rock salt since there is a small chance that the weather will call for snow frequently.
 Besides, people in warm climates wear different clothes from people who live in cold climates. For example, a typical outfit for a man living in California might consist of a T-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops since the weather there is usually warm. However, a man living in Alaska would probably not wear that same outfit since there is snow almost all year round.
Finally, certain activities can only be performed in certain climates. It is possible to do some activities anywhere, such as swimming since indoor pools can be used even when it is freezing outside. This is not possible for other activities such as skiing. Skiing requires a cold climate with snow, which cannot be found in certain places with warm climates such as Hawaii.
In conclusion, climate controls many things in life. Three things climate controls are things people buy, what clothes they wear, and what activities they do.

Y,K2855,29629,cs9,Korean,Male,571,4,w,3943,1,371,368,368,"Sometimes my peers affect me either in positive or negative ways. Also, it is somewhat different how they affect me depending on the length of relationship or how deep relationship is. Although there should be good effects on me by my peers, but I would like to talk about negative effects on me, because negative effects are more easily acquired by people near me. 
 First, it is the most bad effect that I have been affecting by my peers to smoke cigarettes. I learned smoking cigarettes earlier that usual age. When I started to smoke, there were many friends around me who was also smoking. At that time, we didn't recognize that smoking is bad habit and hard to quit. Due to smoking, I feel like that I might make people next to me feel uncomfortable. Also, it has serious bad effects on my health. Even though I know how hard to quit smoking, I am still smoking. 
 Second, I learned bad language by my peers as well and my peer might also learn bad language by me. It is quite bad effect. Because language is one good tool to represent one's characteristics and communicate with other people, it is critical not to use bad language in my daily life. 
 Finally, drinking habit was acquired by me peers. Basically, my body doesn't control well the alcohol, but I did drink a lot with me peers just because they are my friends. It might be silly sound to somebody else, but to maintain good relationship with my peers, having drink together is really important sometimes.
 As I mentioned earlier, there should be positive effects by my peers, but people can learn bad or negative behaviors more easily than positive ones, so it is important to try to stay away from bad behaviors from early age. Once it forms as my habit, it is much more difficult to get my bad habits away from myself.

When I started to smoke, there were many friends around me who was also smoking. At that time, we didn't recognize that smoking is bad habit and hard to quit. Due to smoking, I feel like that I might make people next to me feel uncomfortable. Also, it has serious bad effects on my health. Even though I know how hard to quit smoking, I am still smoking. Second, I learned bad language by my peers as well and my peer might also learn bad language by me. It is quite bad effect. Because language is one good tool to represent one's characteristics and communicate with other people, it is critical not to use bad language in my daily life. Finally, drinking habit was acquired by me peers. Basically, my body doesn't control well the alcohol, but I did drink a lot with me peers just because they are my friends. It might be silly sound to somebody else, but to maintain good relationship with my peers, having drink together is really important sometimes.

The sewage can overflow, and the electricity supply cannot be sufficient or can stop.
 Finally, properties are damaged by natural disasters. Due to the hurricane including heavy rains, the whole village can be flooded and people lose their home.

First of all, do not be absent in any class. Teacher sometimes gives you in-class practices to writing a paragraph. If you are absent on that day, it is hard to make up. Second, do not think too much. The structure of English writing is very clear and organized. When you started to write, just followed the outline steps which teacher taught you, it can help you focus on your main idea.

Even you know many kinds of writing skills or patterns, you still have to review and remember them to demonstrate in your essay.

 If you want to improve your writing ability, it is the best choice to study in the Writing 4 class. We practiced writing during the class. First, the teacher taught us how to write a paragraph. Second, after being familiar with the paragraph, we started to write an essay. There are many ways to write a good essay. We learned about how to use core vocabularies in your writing, how to compare the two different things, and describe causes/ effects. We studied all of these in the class, so after finishing this semester, we already can write an essay by ourselves. Finally, it is important to do the homework. Because you want to write a clear essay, all you have to do is following the steps that the teacher makes you do. I think you will lean a lot of things. Just do your best. You will enjoy the class!!

 As I knew that you are already registered for the next term in the ELI, I wanted to share with you some things that could be useful during your permanence here. In the first place, I highly recommend you to be here one month prior to the beginning of the classes in order to get familiarized with the language. About the initial test, don't be nervous, just prepare yourself during one or two weeks by remembering what you were taught at your hometown and do your best. Once inside the program, you are going to have a lot of homework, but if you have studied a major in your country you will be ok because the ELI academic charge is less than that. 
 You should also enjoy your life here in Pittsburgh; honestly, it is not an exciting place, but you can ask teachers and classmates what to do and where to go, you can also join the activities planned by the ELI or simply let you guide by your intuition and discover places. And please remember that the U.S. is not just for shopping, you have museums, shows, theater and sport games.
 I hope my advice is useful and I wish you the best for your life here in Pittsburgh.

 Can you imagine 1.3 billion people celebrating at the same time? It happens only during the Spring Festival in China. The Spring Festival is the most important traditional Chinese holiday. It usually begins in late January or early February. It depends on which day is the first day of the lunar year in the Chinese calendar, so the Spring Festival is also the Chinese New Year. During the Spring Festival, all family members come together, prepare a lot of food, including a big New Year's Eve dinner, and celebrate for over a week.

 People who are away from home for work or school go home before the Spring Festival. About half a month before the holiday is the busiest time for travel. Airports, railway stations and long-distance bus stations are crowded with people heading home. However busy people are or however far they live from home, they will go back to visit parents and relatives. Sometimes, this is the only chance in the year for some hard-workers or students to go back home. This is the reason why the Spring Festival is so important for the Chinese people.

 In China, food is not just important but a part of culture. It is traditional to eat certain food during the holiday, such as dumplings, nian-gao, fish and spring rolls. These have individual meanings for good fortune. For example, my favorite food is nian-gao. The word ""nian"" means year in Chinese, and the word ""gao"" means high in Chinese, so nian-gao sounds like ""getting higher year by year"". Chinese people always like to save more money at the end of the year, so they like to prepare fish as a main dish because the Chinese pronunciation of fish sounds like ""more saving"". Most people like spring-roll very much because it contains pork and vegetables. They are very nutritious and delicious. The big New Year's Eve dinner is the most important in a year, so it must be abundant and there is a great variety of different dishes. 

 There are a lot of activities during the Spring Festival, and people usually start to prepare for the celebration of the Festival a week before. They decorate their houses with red lanterns and red paper-cuttings. They buy a lot of food. On New Year's Eve, families get together at the grandparents' house usually at noon. Some of them start to prepare the big dinner, and the other people chat, watch TV, and play card games. People usually go out to see fireworks after dinner and again at midnight. Many people set off fireworks on the streets. With the sound and light of fireworks, you can absolutely feel the atmosphere of the Spring Festival. This is my favorite part of Spring Festival.

 The most important holiday in China is a great time for people to get together and celebrate. There are a lot of food and activities, and it's always an exciting and happy moment for 1.3 billion people.

 China is a historical country that has many traditional festivals.  The most famous of these festivals is The Spring Festival.  It begins on the first day of the lunar calendar and ends on the 15th, which is The Festival of Lanterns.  Three days before The Spring Festival, people usually just hang out at the city's flower market with friends.  In China, The Spring Festival is a holiday for family reunions.  Visiting relatives is the major activity.  People in my country love this warm festival and begin to prepare for it over a week in advance, working on red decoration, grand dinner, and plans to visit family.
 The first thing in people's preparation is decorating the home with red as a major color,  because red is a lucky color in the Chinese tradition.  Some families that have seniority usually buy a lot of new red decoration, such as red carpets, red lanterns, and red scrolls, all of which are essential.  The scrolls will usually be put on the door or wall because the scrolls mean luck and have been a Chinese custom since long ago.  In addition, many families will buy different kinds of flowers to make their home look more vibrant. Some families will even repaint the interior of their home so that they can get everything looking new in order to welcome the New Year's coming.  Although the process of preparation costs time and energy, all of the people are willing not only to prepare in these ways for this festival but also to enjoy it.
 When the day of the festival is close, many mothers begin to prepare food for the lunar New Year's Eve dinner.  This is the last dinner of the year, and it's important because it's a dinner for reunion.  The members of a family have dinner together and share their memories of the past. The big dinner is always includes various kinds of foods, such as chicken, beef, pork, vegetables, fruits, and so on.  Of course, rice is the staple food.   Long after dinner, the seniors will still be talking freely;   however, teenagers may go to the city's flower market and gather to welcome in the New Year by counting down the seconds.  That final night is the most joyful night of the year.
 One of the most important activities during the Spring Festival is visiting relatives.  All of the children love visiting relatives because of the ""lucky"" money.  Lucky money is packaged in a red packet, which people who are married give as a gift to children or to someone who is still single.   Giving lucky money is one of the customs in China, signifying the wish that children and singles grow up healthy and happy.  Children regard the lucky money as their own pocket money because they can not only buy new clothes but also food or whatever they want.  Now, you might understand a little better why children love visiting relatives during The Spring Festival.   For adults who are always busy working, on the other hand, visiting relatives is also important.  They may have no free time to get together with relatives during the year. The Spring Festival, then, is a holiday for family reunion. 
 It is a long process from the preparation of the celebration to the end.  The people can wind down from their jobs and enjoy relaxing.  It's also a good beginning of a new year.  People use the festival to restore their energy so that they will be more rested and better focused to engage in their jobs in the next year.  The 15th day of the holiday is the Festival of Lanterns, which signals the end of The Spring Festival.  All of which means that  after enjoying the wonderful holiday, the people begin to focus on their work again.

Now, you might understand a little better why children love visiting relatives during The Spring Festival. For adults who are always busy working, on the other hand, visiting relatives is also important. They may have no free time to get together with relatives during the year. The Spring Festival, then, is a holiday for family reunion. It is a long process from the preparation of the celebration to the end. The people can wind down from their jobs and enjoy relaxing. It's also a good beginning of a new year. People use the festival to restore their energy so that they will be more rested and better focused to engage in their jobs in the next year. The 15th day of the holiday is the Festival of Lanterns, which signals the end of The Spring Festival. All of which means that after enjoying the wonderful holiday, the people begin to focus on their work again. ",3,

It is a day that people living far away from home go back, a day that family came together to prepare for the cerebration and enjoy itvisit friends at the first day of new year! For me It is the most joyful time in the entire year, and the very first happiness begins at the preparation.
 People always start the preparation a week before new year eveDoors and window panes are often painted red, considered to be a lucky color. In addition, people like to hang paper cuts on doors and windows. We don't clean for the first few days of the New Year - if you do any sweeping during this time, you risk sweeping away your good luck. In order to rejoice at the New Year, people wished others a happy new year and blessed heartily. it is really fun that prepare those things with family 
By the eve of the New Year, everyone tries to come back home from every corner of the country to join the entire family, A big New Year dinner is served. Here is one interesting thing about dinner; we put a clean coin into dumpling!! If you eat dumpling and find the coin you will be very lucky next yearAlso, we have fun activities called""BAINIAN"";Everyone said ""Happy New Year ""to each other, and children receive a red envelope decorated with gold symbols and filled with ""lucky money""! We will have a lot of firework when the New Year come, And in my family we will watch a TV show which is only for Spring Festival in ever year
 The first morning of New Year, people put on their new clothes and shoes. Men, with their wives, call on relatives and friends to wish them a ""Happy and Prosperous New Year "". The caller is served tea with sweet-meats; melon seeds, both red and black; and fruits and delicacies such as puffed rice cakes, dumplings and deep-friedh round doughnuts. People beginning go out to visit friends and relatives, taking with them gifts such as fruit, wine, flowers, etc. This period is a time for visiting and amusement.
 According to an ancient legend, people were once tormented by a beast called a Nian - a ferocious creature with an extremely large mouth, capable of swallowing several people in a single bite. Relief from the Nian came only when an old man tricked the beast into disappearing. In reality, New Years festivities probably evolved from a desire to celebrate the end of winter and the fertility and rebirth that come with spring, much like many cultures paration. Today, New Years in China is about family reunions and wishing everyone good fortune in the coming year. I just love it!!!

   There are two crucial holidays that celebrate the coming new seasons in Korea. One of them is 'Sul-day', which is held on new year's day in moon calendar. We include the day before and after Sul-day as holy days so that we can spend more time with family and relatives and take break from strict daily life. On Sul-day, we have a special ceremony for about an hour early in the morning to express respect to our ancestors. Our tasks are definitely specified before, during, and after the ceremony. 
   Usually we start preparing for the ceremony several days before Sul-day, by taking on each person a role. First, we go to a huge grocery store to purchase many kinds of ingredients in as high quality as we can. Then the women of the group keep cooking until the ceremony begins. Meanwhile men clean the home, set up a place for ceremony, and help the women with tasks, such as carving. As we cooperate with each other, we realize the importance of every single person and make our minds clean and calm. This preparation is as integral as doing the main ceremony in the precise order.
   After finishing all the preparation, finally we do the main ceremony following traditional rules. Above all, we do not eat any food until the ceremony is over because eating earlier than elders is considered taboo in Korea. We mark the beginning of the ceremony by opening the front door and windows a little bit so that our ancestors can get in. When everything is ready, we do a conventional greeting, named 'Jul', on the side where there are altars and a low table, on which many things are put, such as food, candles, and a special sheet that shows who the owner of this meal is. Performing Jul is similar to the way of praying in Buddhism, and it is done in the order of age or authority of the relatives. When we finish it all in a solemn ambiance, eventually we start talking and eating freely.
   The last thing that we do, by contrast, happens in a lively atmosphere. We have a big meal and taste all stuff we made, and then we straighten up the space where the ceremony was done. After the meal, we take a rest and say hello to each other by doing Jul. At this time, Jul has a little different meaning with the one in the ceremony; the previous one is to pray for a peaceful life to our ancestors, and later one is to appreciate our elders for taking care us well. Therefore, usually young people greet older relatives by doing Jul. At the same time, the older people accept the greeting sitting on the floor, and then they give some pocket money, called 'New Year's Jul money', to the younger people. This moment is cherished especially by kids, and of course it was always a quite meaningful event for me when I was a child.
   Every time we go through this holiday, it is likely to be regarded as a complicated and exhausting process because of the tight schedule which includes preparation, ceremony, and arrangement after the ceremony, which should be done in only 3 days. However, Sul-day is definitely a valuable event for Korean people to stay with family and relatives, to appreciate everyone surrounding us, and to pray for a healthful and stable future. Because of these reasons, Sul-day has been generated for a long time and thought to be one of the most considerable festivals in Korea.","There are two crucial holidays that celebrate the coming new seasons in Korea.

 Apparently, Jesus Chirst didn't take an interest in Spain. However, this country is still commemorating his actions 2000 years later. One of the most important was his death and resurrection, what Catholics celebrate as Holy Week. Nowadays, Spain is one of the countries where this tradition is lived with more passion.

 The holiday lasts a whole week for students, but the significant days are Thursday, Friday and Sunday because, as traditions says, Jesus died during the night between these two first days and came back to life on the next Sunday. The big deal of this celebration is the processions, the Passion's representation, when Christ walked to the Calvary Mount. The date is variable: it starts on the first Sunday after the initial full moon after the spring equinox, so the date of the Resurrection falls between March 22 and April 25. Actually, it's also the time when good weather comes to Spain, so the streets fill up with people.

 Probably, the most amazing place to enjoy the Holy Week is Seville. The outstanding churches have their own Christ carrying his cross. The images, over a kind of chariot named ""paso"", are transported by brotherhoods all along the city during the whole day. Everyone stays on the street and the most devout people follow Jesus along with a band which plays a music seems like a march.

 I'm not a religious person. Actually, I don't believe in God, but I must admit that I like this ceremony. You're waiting with the crowd, the sun goes down and then, you hear music far away. Step by step, the ""paso"", adorned with a lot of flowers and candles, comes closer. The people, up in the balconies and down in the streets, keep quiet. Suddenly, the image of Christ stops to rest (the ""paso"" weighs 3 tons) and an anonymous man from somewhere in the street spontaneously begins singing a ""saeta, a devotional flamenco song. Finally, the ""paso"" rises up as soon as the band starts to play again while everybody applauds. At the end of the celebration, people come back home, and if they're hungry, it's the perfect moment to eat a ""torrija"", a traditional dessert made with bread soaked in milk and eggs, fried on a little bit of oil, and cinnamon added.

 Nowadays, Holy Week can means vacation, tradition, religion, folklore, traveling or an old fashioned stuff, depending on the person. However, the important thing is respect: understand each other, to know why we celebrate it and, of course, enjoy the holidays.

However the difference is that players have to keep standing on the board while they are playing. And this is not a competition, just for fun. Celebrating new year's day is important to the whole world. In Korea, there is no big parade or boisterous festival in 'Seol'. However, people spend time with family and pray that the new year will be a happy and comfortable year. These are the reasons why 'Seol' is the representative holiday in Korea.",3,

Every New Years all the Porteños take part in different activities; everybody is planning and preparing for an amazing night. When I remember those times in Valparaiso I can only think about all the families doing three things: making a traditional meal, preparing a party and waiting to see the lights above the sea. 
Every family has a special and traditional menu; early in the morning every mother goes to the market thinking of everything she needs for the night, they try to find the best meat, fresh fish, and vegetables for their special dinner.  The reason for this search is that the dinner will be the last for that year and the first for the next year. Every year my mom makes the same food. Sometimes it is fun to try to guess if she will prepare something new because she never does. Our menu is meat with carrots, onion, garlic, cilantro and other condiments accompanied by rice, and salad made with potatoes and tomatoes. My mom prepares dessert every year but we never have time and always forget to eat. I can't forget to mention our traditional liquor for the holiday. Its name is Cola de mono. It's delicious and sweet. Its ingredients are milk, coffee, cinnamon, cloves and ""agua ardiente"" (A south American liquor that's like white brandy but stronger). 
After deciding which will be your dinner, every family starts to organize the house for the party. Everybody puts ornaments about the New Year and summer on their walls. I think that the most important part of New Year's Eve is the music you choose for that moment. The idea is to mix a new song with old traditional music. Every Chilean knows which songs everybody wants to listen to that night; for example, Tommy Rey and their band.  All day people are listening to music everywhere because all of Valparaiso is exited and waiting for the night. Then the people see the fireworks and go back to their houses and begin the party which lasts until the next day.
Finally, when the dinner is over around eleven pm every family or person walks close to the sea because everybody wants to see and to hear the fireworks. At twelve o'clock everybody can listen to ships sounding and they let them know that it is ready and everybody hugs each other, opens the champagne and everybody toasts for the next year.  In this moment everybody is friends with everybody.  It's really fun and special. Then the show begins and people can see thousands of lights on the sea and in the sky. There are many colors and different forms.  They are amazing because you can feel the sound in your body. It is like a shaking and it moves you emotionally.
In summary, for me it is the best time in the year for Valparaiso because everybody wants to visit and to be there that night celebrating.  I recommend that people experience New Years in Valparaiso if they have the opportunity.

Everyone has to learn how to stand out above the rest of other people. Applying for a job successfully underlies several steps preparations. If they can learn how to create a clear resume, find out interests, and do preparation for the interview, it will be beneficial to apply for a job.
First of all, before applying for a job, creating a clear resume is an essential and basic step. Resumes are our representatives. It is said that well begun is half done. A clear and organized resume can let company managers recognize you immediately and help you have higher opportunities than others to have chances to have interviews. Moreover, even though you have a lot of experience and awards, do not write over one page because the managers in companies do not spend much time reading your resume, which is like a biography, so just keep it to one page and make everything clear.
Second, after completing the resume, people have to find out their interests. This step can help them to choose an appropriate job. It is believed that all people anticipate having a perfect job which includes high incomes, high status, and light workload. However, many people have lots of complains about their work because they do not have any passion for their work, so even they have a seeming perfect job, they still feel unhappy. According to this point, although some considerable elements of an ideal job such as income, stability, position, and profits are important, the interests are the most crucial part to lead you to look for a proper job.
Finally, the last and most important step is doing preparation for the interview. It is said that dress for success is common sense because dressing decides the first impression of interviewers. In addition, do not forget to search for company's information. Generally if you mention the visions or the historical backgrounds of the companies when you response to the interviewers, you will be hired as much as possible because you reveal that you really care about this job and did the preparation well. Sometimes a few interviewers pretend to be tough and give you a dilemma question in order to observe your reaction and EQ. Therefore, remember keeping your smile during the interview even you feel nervous or have a setback, and be aware of expressing yourself sincerely and basic manners.
In conclusion, applying for a job is a necessary issue which everybody has to face. It is like a challenging process which everyone should overcomes by himself. If people who want to apply for a job can keep these steps in mind by creating a clear resume, finding out their interests, and doing preparation for the interview, they will get ideal jobs successfully.

 In modern society, many people are studying a new language for the wealthier life. Most people learn English because English is the common language of the world these days. But considerable people learn new languages such as Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, etc., not just English. The reasons for a learning new language might be different according to each person. For example, someone could learn it to have a job or enter a university. Another could learn it for just self-satisfaction. Even if the reasons are different, people have a similar way and experience to study the new language because there are good means for everyone to study the new language efficiently. The most important thing to study the new language is making an environment to use the new language. To make the environment for using the new language, there are three things recommending: have much more time with a native speaker, watch TV without any subtitles, make a friend using the internet. 
 First, having much more time with a native speaker is the most important thing to improve skills of a new language. Nowadays, many people go to the U.S for the purpose studying English. There is a reason for doing it, even though they need much money. In their country which is not the U.S, they can study English, but English which is studied in not the U.S will be limited to improve much. If they go to the U.S, they will have time to speak with native speakers. Then their English will improve, and a pronunciation will be more natural. But if they study English in their country, they will have problems of the pronunciation and improvement which is very slow. Other languages are the same. Even if you don't have much money to go to another country, find in your country a native speaker using the language which you'd like to learn. 
 If you can't go to a foreign country, watching TV without any subtitles is an efficient way to study a new language. You can watch movies and news of other countries on TV, and find many movies, news, dramas, and entertainments on the internet, too. Watching these things is a privilege to study the new language. Because people in old times couldn't have opportunities to encounter foreign programs on TV and the internet. Therefore, you can't throw away the opportunities to watch the programs of other countries. If you do that, your listening skills for the new language will improve. Though it takes a lot of time and you can't listen well, you can be familiar easily to new language you want to learn. 
 Finally, making a friend on the internet is an interesting way to study a new language. The internet is very useful for learning the new language. You can meet friends on the internet, though it is not a direct meeting. The pen-pal is a popular way to make friends. Before the internet is used generally, people wrote a letter to foreign friends. But now, people contact pen-pal friends by sending the e-mail. It is the easy way to keep in touch. Chatting sites are also used to meet foreign friends on the internet. You have to think quickly to make conversation. Even if you don't have fluent conversation at first, it is remarkably helpful to improve your new language. Making a friend on the internet, even though some friends can have a little bit of a strange mind, can help you study the new language. 
 Studying a new language is fun to people who is beginner. Not to lose the fun, you have to find how to study a new language. Making an environment to use the language is the best method for that. Meet native speakers directly in real life and indirectly in virtual life on the internet, and in the media. If you do that, you will get a great environment to study a new language. Consequently, the language won't be new for you anymore.

If they go to the U.S, they will have time to speak with native speakers. Then their English will improve, and a pronunciation will be more natural. But if they study English in their country, they will have problems of the pronunciation and improvement which is very slow. Other languages are the same. Even if you don't have much money to go to another country, find in your country a native speaker using the language which you'd like to learn. If you can't go to a foreign country, watching TV without any subtitles is an efficient way to study a new language. You can watch movies and news of other countries on TV, and find many movies, news, dramas, and entertainments on the internet, too. Watching these things is a privilege to study the new language. Because people in old times couldn't have opportunities to encounter foreign programs on TV and the internet. Therefore, you can't throw away the opportunities to watch the programs of other countries. If you do that, your listening skills for the new language will improve. Though it takes a lot of time and you can't listen well, you can be familiar easily to new language you want to learn. Finally, making a friend on the internet is an interesting way to study a new language. The internet is very useful for learning the new language. You can meet friends on the internet, though it is not a direct meeting. The pen-pal is a popular way to make friends. Before the internet is used generally, people wrote a letter to foreign friends. But now, people contact pen-pal friends by sending the e-mail. It is the easy way to keep in touch. Chatting sites are also used to meet foreign friends on the internet. You have to think quickly to make conversation. Even if you don't have fluent conversation at first, it is remarkably helpful to improve your new language. Making a friend on the internet, even though some friends can have a little bit of a strange mind, can help you study the new language. Studying a new language is fun to people who is beginner. Not to lose the fun, you have to find how to study a new language. Making an environment to use the language is the best method for that. Meet native speakers directly in real life and indirectly in virtual life on the internet, and in the media. If you do that, you will get a great environment to study a new language. Consequently, the language won't be new for you anymore.",3,Not 3lang

This diversity among African countries cannot be explain entirely by wars, poverty, incomes or virus mutations. Instead, other factors such as less condom use and age disparate sex could be the determinant factors to explain how African countries have different HIV prevalence rates. Rosling discloses about factors that conditioned HIV effective transmission, such as sexual concurrency. He seems to insinuate that serial monogamy might be less relevant on HIV heterosexual transmission in comparison with sexual concurrency where HIV spread may be worst. Rosling concludes saying that preventing HIV transmission instead of drug therapy is the key to end with this epidemic.

And what is truer than thru to explain it? ""A Story"", she answers to herself. And just like she started -talking about passion through the Olympics story- she explains through stories essential aspects of creativity, fight against poorness and the need of feminism. Don't forget she is a story teller. 

Allende illustrated creativity through the story of Rose Mapendo in Congo. This woman saw how her husband was tortured and killed, and she invented strategies to have her nine children alive; she also found a way to save her oldest daughter of a rape. Allende explains that creativity and a fearless heart are completely linked; you can have one without the other. 

Allende talked about the fight against poorness telling the story of Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya, who created a program to help the poorest women to plant threes. Her idea was that this women could live of the threes goods and also help the global environment. After the program, theses women had better incomes and trained other women to do the same.

The writer also told the story about the day that her daughter, Paula, made fun of her and said that feminism is dated. Allende explains that feminism is dated for privileged woman like Paula, but not for the most of woman in the world, who are still forced in premature marriage, forced work and prostitution. She explained: ""Although women do two-thirds of world's labor, they own less than one per cent of the world's assets"". She also said that for one dollar that women's programs get, 20 dollars are designated for men's programs. The difference is huge if it's considered that women are 51% of humankind. Allende finished her presentation challenging the audience: What kind of world do we want? She asked. It's time to change our civilization, she concluded.

Flow in the sense expressed in the text ""The Creative Spirit"", is a state of total immersion inside a topic or a creation. When ""flow"" is reached it means that the mind is engrossed around one topic, the time sensation disappears and the potential to produce something original is the higher point. The last time that I experienced a ""flow state"" was when I was writing the comparison contrast essay for my writing class. The circumstances around this state were: total concentration around my subject, cero interruptions and a profound reading to the supporting material that I was dealing with. It was at this time when I could write more extensively. Individual learners should propitiate this state submerging in a state of total concentration. To achieve that, they must be able to leave behind all worldly preoccupations and set their mind ready to encourage a new creation.

It is believed that high technologies not only enhance the quality of our life, but also make our life more convenient. They shorten the distance between countries and people and affect our world to become a small village. Skype, which is the most popular online communication software, has become a trendy media as well as a cell phone because you can call people's cell phones number by using it. Skype and a cell phone have several features in common such as easy operation, communicative convenience, and saving time. However, a comparison between Skype and cell phones reveals some surprising differences in quality, price, and internet.
 First of all, the quality of communication is a basic requirement. No one wants to be interrupted because of an unstable signal. Although Skype is a useful program to contact people, it will be unstable if you use the talking function and the webcam at the same time. Therefore, based on this point, the quality of communication on a cell phone is better than on Skype. However, there is a shortcoming in the cell phone's webcam, which is that the screen is too small. Thus, when people want to see each other with using a webcam, they still always choose Skype.
Second, price is always considered, and that is why Skype is so popular because it is free. The only thing you have to do is apply for a new account on the Skype program and log in; then you can contact your friends anywhere in the world as long as they also have accounts on Skype. Therefore, Skype is considered to be international students' favorite. Now, in order to compete with the cell phone market, Skype also develops some telephone programs which cost less money than a cell phone. Therefore, you can pay the normal telephone fees for the international calling via Skype's programs. If people who have lived abroad for a long time are used to using a cell phone and also want to save money, they can buy a specific international calling card. Although it is more expensive than Skype's program, it is still a good way to save money.
 Finally, internet is a crucial factor which affects Skype and cell phones. Skype is restricted by internet. If you don't have internet, your will not gain access to Skype. When you go outside, even though you can search for a wireless network, you might worry about the information security problem because you do not know where the hackers are. Although you can connect to internet by your cell phone, you have to pay extra fees. According to this point, a cell phone is indeed more useful and safer than Skype when you contact people outside.
In conclusion, the main purpose of technical advancement is to bring us a more convenient and ideal life. People have more options when they want to contact someone. It depends on their circumstance and needs. If you can try to evaluate the quality, price, and internet, you will have an enjoyable communication with others in a money-saving way.

 After working for a period of time, some people may want high positions, such as being managers. However, there are few high positions in most companies. In Taiwan, when employers hire people, the most crucial condition is the diploma of the employee. Therefore, if someone pursues further education, it will make him more competitive. When people in Taiwan decide to pursue further education, they have two main choices: studying abroad or studying in Taiwan. It is not an easy decision to make when you do not understand the differences. There are three initial differences between graduate schools in Taiwan and in other countries: tuition, reputations, and promotion opportunities in the future.
 First of all, there is a huge gap between the tuition in Taiwan and in other countries. For example, the cost of most graduate schools in Taiwan is about three thousand to five thousand US dollars for one semester. However, it costs more than ten thousand US dollars for only one semester when you study in America. It depends on the school. Take the cost of MBA programs for example: it is about fourteen thousand for the University of Pittsburgh, but it costs more than twenty thousand, just for one semester at CMU. In addition, the cost of life in the US is more expensive than in Taiwan. Therefore, you have to pay four to six times more money to get your master's degree.
 Secondly, the reputation of schools is also a crucial factor. To be honest, it is not easy to attend a respected graduate school in Taiwan. It is believed that it is very competitive. Specifically, you must be one of the elites to be able to attend the best one. However, the ranking of the best graduate school in Taiwan is not in the top one hundred in the world. Compared to the graduate schools in Taiwan, there are about 50 schools in the US that are in the top one-hundred ranking. Furthermore, most of the top one hundred schools in the US are well known in the world. Therefore, choosing a high reputation school in the US is thought to be a better choice.
 Finally, you will have more promotion opportunities and satisfying salaries when you have a respected diploma, particularly, if you have a master's diploma from one of the top one hundred schools in the US. To illustrate, if you are trying to find a job in a multinational company, your international experiences and education are your best advantages. Moreover, having a diploma from one of the top one hundred schools in the US means you have enough English communication abilities to talk to foreign people. On the other hand, if you prefer to work as a local culture career, such as historians of Taiwan history, it is better that you have a master from graduate schools in Taiwan. The employers may see local culture more important when you apply this kind of jobs.
 In conclusion, the three main differences of graduate schools between studying in the in Taiwan and studying abroad are tuition, reputations, and salaries in the future. Although you have to spend much more money when you study abroad, you may get a more respected diploma and a higher salary. It depends on the jobs you will have.

 When ELI students come to the United States, they are first worried whether rented housing or a homestay is better. Most of them simply think rented housing is better because living alone is more comfortable. However, this choice is not simple and they should consider many things related to American life. Sometimes, living alone is inconvenient and a homestay can eliminate loneliness.
 Compared to a rented housing, staying with an American family has many advantages. For example, although an ELI student comes to the United States, it is not easy to have a continuous relationship with Americans. A homestay makes it possible to have the relationship ( You want me to correct from 'the' to 'something', but in my opinion, I intend to mean 'a continuous relationship' in a just before line. If my opinion is incorrect, please let me know a correction ). On the assumption that a homestay host is a normal Pittsburgher who is kind, whenever the ELI student wants to talk such as when they watch TV or when they eat something, he or she can communicate with his or her host. In addition, when they have a question, the host would gladly want to provide help. Furthermore, they can enjoy a party with the owner. When I was an ELS student in Point Park University, one of my friends who is from Japan lived in a homestay. The relationship between my friend and the host was better. She always went with the owner to many parties to which the owner was invited. At the result, she could make many American friends. It is important to meet many Americans because the reason we come to the United Stated is not only to learn English, but also to experience American culture. In addition, compared to a rented house, a homestay is cheaper. ELI students can save money because they can share furniture and many sturff (sorry, but I can't find a appropriate word ) which are usually not expensive and not necessary, but sometimes needed. If ELI students decide to live alone, they have to buy or borrow a lot of furniture which is very expensive. Finally, a homestay might make ELI students feel at home. When ELI students miss their countries and family, they can talk with their hosts who would try to make them feel better.
 Of course, living alone might be more comfortable because people inherently like to have an independent place, which is the most important factor to ELI students who choose living alone. ELI students can enjoy freedom without any interruption and bring their friends home. For instance, they can give a party. In the party, they can meet and make many different countries' friends who understand and share each student's problem in foreign life. It can make them get more close with friends. In addition, one of the most efficient ways to learn English is to make a girl friend or boy friend. When they live alone, it is easier to make a girl friend or a boy friend, because if ELI students live in a homestay, they feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, when ELI students want to do what they like, they can do anything such as sleeping late and returning home late, and they can even go around in home without wearing clothes, if they want.
 In conclusion, Everything related to choosing between a rented housing and a homstay depends on each student's character and lifestyle.

Y,K3068,33939,ha2,Korean,Female,638,5,w,4350,1,865,860,860,"Do you have your ID on Facebook? Facebook, the social network web site, is one of the most popular sites in the world. It has approximately three hundred million members from all around the world. However, if you are Korean, you probably have an ID on Cyworld, which is a Korean social network website. Moreover, more than half of Korean people have an ID on Cyworld, even if they don't have an ID on Facebook. Basically, main concepts and functions of both sites are similar. For example, you can communicate with your friends, upload and show your pictures and movies, and publish messages on your wall. Also, they might help you broaden and deepen your social network by sharing thoughts, and expressing your interests. However, there are several factors that make Cyworld and Facebook different from each other, such as, connections with a portal site, main target, and design. 
 First, being connected with a portal site or not is one difference. In the case of Cyworld, it is connected with a large portal site, named Nate. Recently, Nate merged with Cyworld completely, and it provides a search service, e-mail service, and news content. Thus, people can search for information and manage their own home page on the same website. For this reason, people who are good at multitasking tend to prefer Cyworld. On the other hand, Facebook focuses on human networking and it does not have e-mail service or news content. Relatively simple contents and interface attract not only young people, but also adults, so Facebook has a huge range of users. 
 Second, the main target of each site is different. Cyworld is a domestic service, which means most of users are Korean. Therefore, the company can reflect hot issues in Korea to make items to decorate homepages. If ANON_NAME_0-Na Kim gets a gold medal in figure skating in the Winter Olympics, the company might make a lot of items related to her to sell to people. In addition, a lot of Korean movie stars and singers have this home page, and they show their private lives, and current feeling. Sometimes, news reporters observe the celebrities' homepages, and they write articles from them. Thus, it is thought that Cyworld is completely customized to Korean. On the contrary, the target of Facebook is everyone all around the world. Therefore, we can make friends from other countries by sharing thoughts and information. Also, we can be a fan or a member of numerous clubs and ANON_NAME_1 about world famous people or characters, such as Family Guy, Paris Hilton, and Johnny Depp. We can meet other people from different countries in those ANON_NAME_1. In addition, Facebook is an effective way to deepen human networks for international businessmen, and people who stay abroad. If people, especially young people, are in the United States, they will meet people who have various backgrounds, and they can be close friends by using Facebook. Even though they did not have a time to talk about their private lives in the meeting or in class, they can share their private lives on facebook by uploading pictures, writing a message, and responding to their pictures and messages. Therefore, it is said that Facebook is an essential tool to for people who have a connection with foreign people. 
 Finally, design another difference between Cyworld and Facebook. For example, the size of Cyworld is smaller than Facebook because the size of Cyworld is 932 by 538 pixels, whereas Facebook is viewed in full screen. Also, on Cyworld, you can decorate your homepage by purchasing items, which includes homepage design, music, and fonts. Although the company provides a basic home page design to everyone, many people, especially young people or women, want to decorate their home ANON_NAME_1 more beautifully and more uniquely. For them, the expression of themselves is important in cyber space as well as in real life. In addition, people can resize and edit their pictures by using editing tools. Pictures can be put together and decorated by text and stickers, which makes people more engaged and interested. On the other hand, the design, provided by Facebook is simple. The main colors are blue, white, and black, and every home looks same. People cannot decorate their homepages by buying other designs. It seems to be more focused on the original functions of Facebook, for example, communication, uploading pictures, and writing a short message. People do not need to spend extra money to decorate their cyber house, and do not need to compete with friends in how they make their home page better. Also, the uploading speed of pictures on Facebook is faster than Cyworld, so people can upload a greater number of pictures, up to 200 at once, which is convenient. 
 Many people are eager to share their experiences and feelings with other people, and they stretch their communication to the social networking sites in cyber space. Both Cyworld and Facebook give us places to express ourselves, even though there are several differences in system, target, and design. As the IT technology grows so fast, their services will be developed more and there could be more fun sites in the future. 
","Do you have your ID on Facebook? Facebook, the social network web site, is one of the most popular sites in the world. It has approximately three hundred million members from all around the world. However, if you are Korean, you probably have an ID on Cyworld, which is a Korean social network website. Moreover, more than half of Korean people have an ID on Cyworld, even if they don't have an ID on Facebook. Basically, main concepts and functions of both sites are similar. For example, you can communicate with your friends, upload and show your pictures and movies, and publish messages on your wall. Also, they might help you broaden and deepen your social network by sharing thoughts, and expressing your interests. However, there are several factors that make Cyworld and Facebook different from each other, such as, connections with a portal site, main target, and design. First, being connected with a portal site or not is one difference. In the case of Cyworld, it is connected with a large portal site, named Nate. Recently, Nate merged with Cyworld completely, and it provides a search service, e-mail service, and news content. Thus, people can search for information and manage their own home page on the same website. For this reason, people who are good at multitasking tend to prefer Cyworld. On the other hand, Facebook focuses on human networking and it does not have e-mail service or news content. Relatively simple contents and interface attract not only young people, but also adults, so Facebook has a huge range of users. Second, the main target of each site is different. Cyworld is a domestic service, which means most of users are Korean. Therefore, the company can reflect hot issues in Korea to make items to decorate homepages. If ANON_NAME_0-Na Kim gets a gold medal in figure skating in the Winter Olympics, the company might make a lot of items related to her to sell to people. In addition, a lot of Korean movie stars and singers have this home page, and they show their private lives, and current feeling. Sometimes, news reporters observe the celebrities' homepages, and they write articles from them. Thus, it is thought that Cyworld is completely customized to Korean. On the contrary, the target of Facebook is everyone all around the world. Therefore, we can make friends from other countries by sharing thoughts and information. Also, we can be a fan or a member of numerous clubs and ANON_NAME_1 about world famous people or characters, such as Family Guy, Paris Hilton, and Johnny Depp. We can meet other people from different countries in those ANON_NAME_1. In addition, Facebook is an effective way to deepen human networks for international businessmen, and people who stay abroad. If people, especially young people, are in the United States, they will meet people who have various backgrounds, and they can be close friends by using Facebook.

 Long times ago, there were few students living in other regions, not their hometown with family. On the contrary, in modern society, people get out of their hometown to live in the developed regions which have a better educational environment.

Sometimes, if people want to bring their friends to their home, they can invite friends to their home without any permission of roommates when they live alone. On the contrary, people can't invite their friends to their home without asking for roommates' consent. In addition, occasionally, some people disagree when they have to decide something.

Pancakes, eggs, or yogurt, these are the types of choices that my mother has to confront early in the morning each day. My brothers and I are physically very alike, but our personalities couldn't differ more. For instance Kakike, the younger one, likes eggs for breakfast a big meal full of proteins. ANON_NAME_0, the older one, however, sneaks out of the house without eating because he knows that it will take a lot of time to be served and he is always in a hurry. When my mother cooks pancakes, it is my turn to sneak out. I won't have that many calories so early in the morning. Finally both of the boys complain when my mother serves either yogurt or cereal because they claim they get hungry in the middle of the morning. 

Breakfast is not the only thing in which we differ. Our bedrooms are the perfect expression of our differences. Kakike's room is the smallest. He doesn't have many things in it. His bed was my uncle's old one. It is a beautiful dark wooden bed that he had made bigger because he didn't fit in a regular size one witch fits Kakike perfect, because he is very tall. Contrasting with the beautiful bed, he has a horrible desk that my mother was going to toss out years ago when they placed it in Kakike's room ""temporally"". However, Kakike never complained, he is not that interested in looks, so the desk is still there. His walls are all covered with posters, and his dirty clothes hamper is permanently overloaded. He is so lazy, he prefers to send it to clean, before having to fold and organize them. ANON_NAME_0's room, on the other hand is the most organized, all his furniture are from the same ensemble. His bed is always made and his closet well organized. Opposite to Kakike's room you cannot see the hamper for his dirty clothes. It is well arranged inside the closet. The walls are all neatly painted, exposing a collection of all his diplomas. ANON_NAME_0 room is clearly reflect of his organize and perfectionist mind. My room in contrast to my brother's is the biggest and usually the messiest of all. When it is clean, it is also the prettiest. I had all my furniture made in wood and steel and the are in perfect harmony with my nice green curtains that are always open to allow light into the room. The walls are decorated with pictures of my friends and me. My clothes always cause the mess. You can tell when I have a bad clothes day, because I take the time to try them all on but not to organize them again in the closet.

Our hobbies are also very different. When ANON_NAME_0 was little, he gave my father a hard time. He didn't like to play team games as football or baseball, my father's favorites; he likes sports like swimming and golf. Kakike, in the other hand, shared my father's love for team sports. He is a serious basket player and a natural in all the other sports that include a ball or a board. I, instead, am a runner. I love 10k races and all kinds of dances. This difference made it difficult for my mother to schedule our after school activities. She had to find places where they had many sports so that we could all find something to do. 

It is very interesting knowing that three personas as different as my brothers and me were raced by the same parents and under the same roof. Even if we sometimes fight over our difference, we have learned to coexist in peace. We started by doing little compromises as the TV for example. When ANON_NAME_0 is alone he enjoys watching the news or the ""Discovery Channel"". Kakike likes a thing called ""Mangas"" witch are grown-up cartoons, and I like some reality shows as ""American Idol"". Although we like different TV shows, when we are together, we all agree to watch a movie or a comedy series that entertains all of us. 

As we grow older, the little compromises grew with us; they tighten our relationship and become our strength. ANON_NAME_0 was the smartest in his class and also one of the most popular among the girls. Kakike gave him girl advice, and I helped him dress trendy. ANON_NAME_0 in the other hand always had our back. He revised our important papers and helped us stay out of trouble. Definitively, there is nothing wrong about being different other than, the morning argument concerning pancakes, eggs, or yogurt.

Penicillin, which was discovered in 1928 by Fleming, was the first antibiotic 

that cured human disease. Due to this powerful microbial drug, people became 

over-confident to cure diseases. But the advent of bacterial mutation gives 

bacteria a potent power against antibiotics. So, scientists have tried to find 

the undiscovered antibiotics. This video introduces two different ways to find 

new antibiotics from the soil. First of all, the soil of a park in Vancouver 

is collected. Bacteria in that soil are isolated and then microbial DNA is 

manipulated in the lab. Genetically altered microbes are cultured by Robot in 

the Lab. Small discs saturated with chemicals produced by these microbes place 

on the colony of harmful bacteria. Clean circle around discs means that 

harmful bacteria are killed by antibiotics. The second is the soil of 

radioactive environment in Chernobyl. The scientists are thinking that 

radiation cause organism to mutate them. So, they have a theory to find new 

antibiotics from bacteria of this area. 

 In conclusion, human beings have a big problem by the advent of new and 

powerful bacteria to resist current antibiotics. So, we are necessary for 

finding new antibiotics to protect us from these super-resistant microbes. 

Finding new bacteria from these two different soils is the example to show us 

how to find out new antibiotics that can protect us from these antibiotic-

resistant bacteria.

Nowadays, more and more people in Taiwan have high level educations and living standards. Therefore, most couples in this generation get married very late, about thirty to thirty four. Because of the marriages at more mature ages, they plan to have children late. In Taiwan, more and more couples around thirty just want to have only one baby or none. Therefore, the low birth rate is a serious social problem in Taiwan recently. There are three main areas affected by the low birth rate: population structure, educational issue, and economy. 
First of all, the population structure has changed. According to the birth rate research of Central Intelligence Agency (2010), the birth rate in Taiwan is the two hundred and tenth among two hundred and twenty three countries in 2009. The birth rate in Taiwan is about nine. Compare to other country, the birth rate in Niger, the number one in 2009, is about fifty two. Duo to the low birth rate, the aging population has become a problem. In two decades, young people need to support more elderly people, and it will become a heavy burden. Moreover, the government needs more budgets to take care of elderly people in the future. Therefore, the government should come out a constructive plan to encourage couples to have more babies, such as some benefits for children, and parental leave form the employee benefits.
Secondly, due to the low birth rate, the environment of education has become different. In Taiwan, the demand for teachers has decreased. For example, the rate of the teacher recruitment is about 1% (Liberty News, 2009). There are about eight thousand wandering teachers. However, the job vacancies for being formal teachers are only less than one hundred last year. Thousands of the wandering teachers in Taiwan can not find jobs in public or private schools. What could they do? They could attend more teacher recruitments or change their careers. It also means that the government wastes a lot of money and time to train these wandering teachers in colleges. Although one may succeed to be a formal teacher in the public school one day, he may be laid off in few years if there are few students to teach. Moreover, parts of colleges may close for the same reason in the future (Lin Xuejuan, 2008). 
Finally, the low birth rate may affect the economic fields in the future. As a result of young population decreasing, the competition of economy may be depressed. Furthermore, the markets, like toy stores, baby shops, or children book publishers, have reduced due to the low birth rate. Because of the reducing of the markets, the companies compete intensely. Therefore, some small companies can not survive in this competition. It may cause some unemployment. Even some children's hospitals have closed for the same reason. Therefore, some children's hospitals have changed to women's and children's hospitals.
In conclusion, the low birth rate affects three aspects in Taiwan: population structure, education issue, and economy. If we do not solve this problem now, we will face more serious problems in the future. Moreover, we can not only focus on increasing the birth rate, but also educating our next generation appropriately.

Y,C2393,34815,dc0,Chinese,Female,638,5,w,4479,1,705,709,709,"Education is the root of a country. It is also thought that education is a symbol of a country because there is no advanced or developed country has a non-educated system, and that is why no matter what poor or rich countries, they are all emphasize that put education as a priority in their policies. In Taiwan, the government takes education seriously and attempts to improve the quality of education. However, recently years there has existed a phenomenon in Taiwan. That is the few teacher vacancies, especially for elementary school teachers in Taiwan. There are three main reasons for this serious issue such as declining economy, an inappropriate policy, and decreasing birth rate.
 First of all, declining economy is a crucial factor to impact the society in Taiwan. Due to an island, most of businesses in Taiwan are related to international enterprises or overseas markets. Therefore, by declining global economy, people in Taiwan also suffered this pressure and looked for work hardly. During this meant time, many public school teachers wanted to retire because the retirement pay is so plenty. However, the government set a limit to teachers who want to retire and postponed the date of teachers' retirement because if the government guaranteed all retirement requests, it would be a heavy burden of financial difficulty to the country.
 Second, an inappropriate policy influenced the teacher-nurture system a lot. Almost ten years ago, because of the declining global economy, it was hard to look for work. According to the central news agency of Taiwan News (2010) pointed out that comparing now with ten years ago, Taiwan's unemployment rate has grown from higher than 3 percent to 5 percent. Furthermore, the unemployment rate of 25-29 year old people have risen from 3.8 percent to 8.8 percent, and the group of 20-24 brackets has risen from 6.8 percent to 14.7 percent. However, at that time teachers were considered to be an ""Iron Rice Bowl"", which means they don't have to worry about being laid off by government and still can keep high reputation and good salary. Thus, many people wanted to get the teacher license and worked in public schools. This situation caused legislators and Councilors pushed the government revised the law that allows many general universities to have qualification to nurture teachers instead of teacher colleges. As a result of the revised law, the government expanded the approach to develop teachers. A few years later, there were increasing amount of teachers every year. Although it opened the teacher market needs, it still upset the balance between demand and supply.
 Finally, decreasing birth rate is the most serious and critical reason which induced the teacher vacancy problem. When the previous reason met this new issue, decreasing birth rate has begun to destroy the teacher vacancy system completely. Tso (2009) has mentioned that Taiwan had the lowest birth rate, which one woman just has only child, in the world last year. To understand the behind factor of decreasing birth rate, economy is regarded as the principal consideration (Lin, C. Y. Yen, C.L. Yen, ANON_NAME_0, & Chu, 2007). If parents have children, whatever time or cost of children's education would be the burden for the parents. Moreover, in this generation, there are more and more couples who enjoy their marriage without children, and even some people are celibate. According to these factors, decreasing birth rate and increasing teacher rate triggered off overload teachers. People called these overload teachers ""vagrant teachers"", who graduated from teacher school but can not find a job especially elementary school has met this catastrophe first. The government could not solve this serious problem when the fact has been happened, so they fasten the vacancy to candidates for full time teachers in order to control the balance of demand and supply in school. There are many cities in Taiwan even have no vacancy for permanent employees.
 In conclusion, the phenomenon of few teacher vacancies is a chronic situation in Taiwan's educational environment. It is caused by declining economy, an inappropriate policy, and decreasing birth rate. Although the global economic issue can not be solved immediately, the educational problem can not be detained. In order to improve the strength of the country, the government should have positive policy to face it.

To understand the behind factor of decreasing birth rate, economy is regarded as the principal consideration (Lin, C. Y. Yen, C.L. Yen, ANON_NAME_0, & Chu, 2007). If parents have children, whatever time or cost of children's education would be the burden for the parents. Moreover, in this generation, there are more and more couples who enjoy their marriage without children, and even some people are celibate. According to these factors, decreasing birth rate and increasing teacher rate triggered off overload teachers. People called these overload teachers ""vagrant teachers"", who graduated from teacher school but can not find a job especially elementary school has met this catastrophe first. The government could not solve this serious problem when the fact has been happened, so they fasten the vacancy to candidates for full time teachers in order to control the balance of demand and supply in school. There are many cities in Taiwan even have no vacancy for permanent employees. In conclusion, the phenomenon of few teacher vacancies is a chronic situation in Taiwan's educational environment. It is caused by declining economy, an inappropriate policy, and decreasing birth rate. Although the global economic issue can not be solved immediately, the educational problem can not be detained. In order to improve the strength of the country, the government should have positive policy to face it.",3,

According to a survey conducted by Statistics Korea (2009) Korean women's age at marriage was 23.2 in 1981, but it was 28.3 in 2008 (chart 1). It indicates the marriage age has increased 5 years in about three decades. Moreover, it is said that Korean women want to get married at the age of 30.6 in 2009 (Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 2009). There are several reasons why the average age of getting married is on the rise, including financial independence issue, increasing desire of self-achievement, and desire of enjoying a single life.
 First, a financial independence issue delays women's marriage. In Korea, due to the expensive price of the house, many newlyweds begin their new life in a house for on a deposit money basis. However, the deposit is also expensive. Therefore young people have to save money and achieve financial independence before they get married. It leads to delayed marriage. In addition, men's financial independence also can affect the time of women's marriage. For example, Korean men have to be in the military service for 2 years. As a consequence, their time to begin the world is late. Therefore even though women want to get married, their boy friend might have not prepared to get married in the aspect of finance. 
 Second, increasing desire of self- achievement raises the average of women's marriage age. According to a survey conducted by Statistics Korea (2009) the college entrance rate of women has grown up to 82.4 % in 2009 from 31.9 % in 1990. The high college entrance rate of women reflects a desire of self ? achievement. At least 20 years ago, to go to university was not common for women. If they didn't go to university, some of them usually worked as secretary, accounting clerk, and worker in a factory after graduating from a high school, and others stayed at home with their parents helping house work. Then, they tended to get married before they turned 25. To get married seemed to be priority for them. However, these days, 8 out of 10 women go to university and they want to have a career. Moreover, a great number of Korean women go to grad school or study abroad for their professional achievement. It is thought that self-achievement is more important for them than a marriage. Extended duration of study postpones the time of entering workforce, which leads to late marriage. 
 Finally, women want to enjoy their single life more. They want to spend more time as a single lady, finding a better guy because marriage means a promise to be with one guy forever. A few decades ago, women tended to get married their first lovers or their parents arranged their marriage. If a woman had had several boyfriends before married, it was thought to be inappropriate or too liberal. However, these days, women seek for their own spouse by dating with guys. Also, Korean women do not want to be involved marital life early because marriage requires responsibility and sacrifice. Especially in Korea, the relationship with mother-in-law is not easy because mothers who have sons tend to concern about their son excessively. Their concern is attributed to the Korean traditional notion of preferring a son to a daughter. Even though there are many rational mothers-in-law, some mothers still think marriage of their son deprives their son from them. Also, in holidays, including new years day and Korean Thanksgiving day, married women usually work in their in-laws' house. It can be a significant burden for women, so women who have not married have fear about marital life. Therefore they want to enjoy their single life. 
 Marriage is a social system that makes the stable relationship between man and woman possible. Also, many women want to get married. However, financial issue, desire for self-achievement, and advantages of single life defer the time to get married, and it is said that the women's average age of marriage will be higher in the future.

   Modern society regards person's external as important as internal.

   First, there is a positive effect in psychological aspect.  Most people get a plastic surgery to supplement their weakness of external.  For example, most Asian who have tiny eyes and nose get a double-eyelid surgery to have bigger eye and a nose surgery to have higher nose.  And some people who have small breast get a breast implant.  As a study of Sarwer, who is an associate professor of psychology at the Center for Human Appearance at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 87 percent of people receiving cosmetic surgery 1 year ago satisfied with their surgery, including improvements in their overall body image and the body feature altered (DITTMANN, 2005).  As a consequence, the people who don't have confidence because they think that they aren't good-looking can have confidence by the surgeries, and then, for the confidence make them do much more thing. Finally they can change future to be more brightened. What the once of plastic surgery changes person's fortune is really positive psychological effect even if the change of confidence is not tangible at the first.

 About eight years ago, most people worked more than 45 hours a week in South Korea. However, as the number of the unemployed increased, the Korean government announced a policy to reduce the unemployment rate. The Korean government thought that if employees volunteered to reduce their work schedule, the unemployed would have a better opportunity to find a job. As time passed, companies introduced this policy. In this case, we should pose the question: What are the effects of the reduced work schedule on individual?
 First, I will examine the negative effects of a reduced work schedule. The most obvious negative effect is a decrease in income due to the reduced work schedule. The reason is that the income depends on how long time workers spend time to work. They shared the income each other by sharing working time, reducing income. That means that individuals had to spend less money and cut expenses while prices went up. However, as time passed, the income was back on track.
 In addition, workers felt irritated because the environment around workplace was changed a lot. They had to finish a lot of work in a shorter time than before the introduction of the policy. That means that if employees work at the same speed, they can't finish their work. Another major problem is to use the bank. All banks in South Korea were open on Saturdays. However, after the reduced work schedule, they closed on Saturdays. Customers were forced to finish work so that they could use the bank every Friday instead of Saturday.
 On the contrary to these, it also had some positive effects. First, workers would spend more time for family and friends, which strengthened a bond. For example, before the introduction of the reduced work schedule, most workers wanted to take a rest on Sundays, just staying at home, because they felt exhausted to work. However, they would were willing to enjoy the weekends with their family and friends by the benefit of the policy.
Also workers would spend more time for studying and self-improvement. If they want to study more about their career, the companies would adjust time to fit their schedules, and even worker could attend a university class.
Finally, the efficiency of work was improved. Workers would devote themselves to working. Assume two different people. One person had enough time to be refreshed after and before working while the other one lacked. Which one does devote self to working? This question is pretty simple to everyone. The reduced work schedule made it possible, and by extension, made efficient companies, which earned more money and gave more salary to worker.
In either case, most government's policies have both positive and negative effects on us. However, it was true that government tried to make a policy to reduce the employment rate and in part, this policy had a positive effect on workers. At the result of the policy, the quality of lives of workers was improved.

Abortion is generally a controversial topic. Many politicians have devoted parts of their careers debating on the subject. It is a difficult decision to determine if it should be legal or not, because of the many circumstance in witch it can occur, and because, it involves the termination of a life. Even if it is a difficult and controversial topic, it should be discussed, and more importantly, because of its frequency; the effects it produces in society and women should be studied. More than 22 % of the USA pregnancies end up in abortion, witch also means that approximately 2% of the women between 15 and 44 years old abort each year only in America. Following, we will discus, how the decisions of these women affect their life, their partner's life and the society.

It is difficult to predict how an abortion will affect a woman; seven out of ten, think their choice of having a abortion was the correct one, so they live their life as they had before the abortion, but, even this women sometimes can experience some of the psychological traumas that the 30% of the woman that regretted having an abortion do. This traumas, or disorders include depression, anxiety, loss, anger, loose of confidence and guilt. They are usually stronger during the first months after the abortion, but, in some case they persist for a lifetime and in some females it can cause more sever psychological illness. 

There are a significant amount of women that never tell their partners that when they are pregnant, if they are sure they want an abortion, consequently, there are less men that experience an abortion. But this doesn't mean that the men how do experience it, aren't affected. Some men can disassociate themselves from the problem and think that abortion is a viable solution. They usually support their women partner. Other men can be the ones to convince their partners of having the abortion. But, nevertheless, there are many men that fell frustrated with the decision of their partner to abort, and their powerlessness of being able o help their baby. These powerlessness' men can also suffer from psychological disorders, and in some cases they turn to drugs, alcoholism, promiscuity, etc.

As we have seen so far, it seams like abortion's is never positive, but in fact, in some cases were children are truly unwanted abortion should be an option. It is very interesting the point of view of Steve Levitt and Stephen Dubner in their book ""Freakonomics"" (2009), where, they explain that abortion helps reduce the criminal rate. When you think about it, it makes sense. People have more chance of becoming a criminal if they are born in misery, in a family where they are abuse or simply if their parents doesn't take care of them. Therefore, in countries, or cities, where abortions is legalizes, the cities experience a decrease on their criminal rate, starting15-25 years after the law is issued.

Finally, abortion can have a positive effect in societies; thus, in most of the cases it has a negative effect on individuals. Consequently, even governments pro-abortion should try to reduce the alarming rate of occurrence with publicity campaigns, educational programs that target the more affected population and laws that force women to consult psychologists to help them figure out if an abortion is the best option for them.

The first lesson is being curios. He explains how in his childhood he used to play with frogs and snakes, looking at them under the microscope. ""It was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility"", he says. The film maker explains how his curiosity conducted him to read Jacques Cousteau, and how Cousteau books inspired him to be a scuba diver and to find in the oceans different kinds of ideas for his films. 

The second lesson is to think on imagination as a force that can manifests a reality. That, he said, seemed to be the best way to reconcile the urge he had to tell stories, with his urges to create images. Cameron thinks that he owns the success of movies as Terminator, Aliens, Titanic and The Abyss to the mix of curiosity and imagination he had. The director also says that Arthur Clarke's law, ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"", pushed him to bring it to cinematic art; and the use of computer generated animation in Avatar is a sample of it.

The third lesson is that the respect of his team is more important than all the laurels in the world. When he made his last movie, Avatar, he tried to apply a important principle of leadership: ""that you respect your team, and you earn their respect in return"". 
Besides curiosity, imagination and work in a team, Cameron says that when young film makers come up to him and say, ""Give me some advice for doing this"", he answers, ""Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you, don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself. And take risks.""

 Recent years there is a phenomenon that people prefer to have male children rather than have female children. It seems like a trend towards in many cultures especially in Asia. Because the cost of having children at this generation is getting more and heavier than it in many decades ago, many families just only want to have one child. When the parents can choose their child's gender by the advancing technique, they usually prefer to have a male child because males are considered to have quality to inherit the prosperity from the parents. However, this situation causes the unbalance in gender of the population and also triggers several consequences such as the higher male competition, the lack of the normal social contact opportunities, and marriage issue.
 First of all, the higher competition will be a crucial influence during the growth of the males. Whatever in schools or in working places, males suffer much more pressure with other the same gender people than it in the past. Moreover, usually the increasing amounts of men are asked to have higher standard in their study and work from their parents. Therefore, the higher competition will be a serious torment of males.
 Second, the lack of the normal social contact opportunities for men is another problem. Many educational theories have been proven that children studying in a diverse environment can improve their learning and creativity. If the population of the men is much more than women, it will be a pity that male children loose many chances to practice using their communicative skills with female in a normal educational environment, and it might also affect men to have problems about getting along with females in the future.
 Finally, the marriage issue is the most important and realistic problem for the male children when they become adults. Due to the overload of the male population, many men hardly look for a girl friend even their marriage. It is thought that men have less choice when they look for a spouse because the population of men is more than the women. Especially for the men who have low education, under the higher competition with other brilliant men, they have been urged to marry the foreign women who are from poor economic countries. 
 In conclusion, preferring to have male children rather than female children has become a general phenomenon that effects males will have higher competition with the same gender, fewer experiences for social contact with females, and marriage crisis. In order to solve this problem, the government which has this problem has to revise the social policy and publicize an idea that female children are as important as male children.","Recent years there is a phenomenon that people prefer to have male children rather than have female children.

 In the past, most families in Chinese preferred to have a boy rather than a girl. Although it is a trend in the world that having a boy or a girl are the same, some parents still have this thought, especially in Taiwan. There are some crucial reasons that cause this situation in Taiwan.
 First of all, sons share the same last name of their fathers. In order to continue a family, some people like to have a male child rather than a female one. When a woman gets married, she should change her last name. In Chinese culture, this means that she would become one part of her husband family, not her original family anymore. Moreover, her son's name should go after his father. Without a son, one family's last name may disappear.
 Secondly, in the past, most people in the countryside needed to cultivate crops. Besides, most farmers were very poor in the past. In order to maximize the workforce in the farms, most farmers wanted to have male children instead of female ones. Normally, men are physically stronger than women so men can do more laborious work. Therefore, compared to sons, some traditional families in the countryside thought that daughters are useless. Even some parents would prefer to give their daughter to other families rather than raise her. Moreover, because the social welfare was not perfect in the past, a son would take care of his parents when they got older.
 Thirdly, the hereditary monarchy in the past also affects this situation. Under a hereditary monarchy, all the monarchs come from the same family, and the crown is passed down from one member to another member of the family. When a king died, the crown was usually passed to his oldest son. In China, although a king had several wives, the oldest son's mother would be the queen. After several centuries, this thought still exists in some families in Taiwan. For example, there are some entrepreneurs hope to have a son instead of a daughter because they want their sons to continue their family businesses.
 In conclusion, the same last name, the traditional thoughts in the countryside and the hereditary monarchy have influenced the preference for boys in some families in Taiwan. People need to eliminate this concept that sons are much better than daughters. It is not always true that a son would take care of his parents or do some heavy work.","In the past, most families in Chinese preferred to have a boy rather than a girl.

In the world, there are numerous countries which have various culture and custom. Today in some countries including the most oriental countries, many parents prefer to have male children rather than female children. In case of Korea, most parents would like to have male children rather than female children until a few years ago. Even if the number of parents who want to have male children decrease, the tendency has remained until now, because the tendency came from the traditional culture and custom of Korea.
 First, long time ago, a form of family was an extended family in Korea unlike a nuclear family that Americans have been. The reason that the form of family had to be the extended family is a form of society was agricultural society. In order to do farming fluently, people needed much more numbers of families who have a good strength because they cultivated by themselves, not by machines. Thus, parents of Korea in the old days preferred to have male children who have stronger that female children. The tendency of old days is descended to now days, there are parents who would like to have male children rather than female children.
 Second, nowadays, considerable women have their job, not just house keeper in the world. However, long times ago in Korea, Shin Saimdang, the ideal women of Korea historically, was just good wife and wise mother. Therefore women in Korea couldn't help thinking that their work is only helping our children and husband from behind. The woman working in a workplace had been accepted abnormally until 1970s even though there are most women have their job now. As the result, people thought a statue of male working in a workplace is upper than female working in just a house. The thought generated discrimination and a male chauvinist. Furthermore, the thought have caused that many parents prefer to have male children rather than female children.
 Finally, children usually receive father's last name in most countries. In Korea, there are genealogies. Genealogies have been most important thing to assess qualification of person's family. The custom considering genealogies made family line important too. Thus, people have avoided having daughter in order to sustain their family line. Most people have born many daughters for having a son if the people didn't have the son at first time. The custom caused that the number of female in the country increased and male is more precious. Finally, the custom made parents pursue to have male children rather than female children.
 In conclusion, nowadays, the excessive discrimination between female and male children decreases. However, the culture and custom which made parents prefer to have male children are not eliminated because people who lived in the generation of preferring male children extremely have lived until now. Even if they die, the concept which they have had could be continued their children.

Y,K3121,35764,ha2,Korean,Female,638,5,w,4644,1,439,436,436,"These days, a lot of women occupy high position jobs and professional careers, such as professor, researcher, and even heavy equipment operators. It seems that there is not any difference between men and women in many societies. However, some pars of the world, many parents still prefer to have male children rather than female children. They even abort when they knew that the baby in their womb is female. Consequently, the proportion of men is higher than that of women in those societies. Parents in some part of the world prefer boys because of carrying on a family line, physical reason, and biased social recognition of men. 
 First of all, the fact that boys carry on a family line when they grow up makes parents prefer boys. One of the basic desires of humans is keeping their family by producing offspring. In many countries, women follow their husband's last name when they get married. Also, married women are considered a member of their husband's family. Therefore, parents want to have a son who will continue their family. 
 The second reason is that men are physically stronger than women. Traditionally, men have worked for his family, such as hunting, planting whereas women tended to stay at home and take care of their children. It can be attributed to the fact that men are more efficient to work because of their physical strength. Especially, tendency of preference of boy is strong in agricultural societies because physical strength is directly connected to productivity. 
 Finally, parents prefer boys because of the biased social recognition of men. The traditional belief about that men are physically strong and they are more efficient has prevailed a lot of societies. For example, men usually became a king, president, and politicians rather than women who even were not allowed to take a vote. In the matter of fact, women started to participate in work recently in history and some parents didn't change their belief. Also, in some countries, men can get a job easily, get paid higher, and be promoted faster than women because people in those countries think men should take an advanced position more than women. In this sense, parents in some parts of the world still prefer to have boys.
 In conclusion, these days, many women contribute to the society by having a career and their profession, and many people believe there is no crucial difference between men and women. However, in some parts of the world, parents still prefer to have a son than a girl because of carrying on a family line, physical reason, and biased social recognition of men.","These days, a lot of women occupy high position jobs and professional careers, such as professor, researcher, and even heavy equipment operators. It seems that there is not any difference between men and women in many societies. However, some pars of the world, many parents still prefer to have male children rather than female children. They even abort when they knew that the baby in their womb is female. Consequently, the proportion of men is higher than that of women in those societies. Parents in some part of the world prefer boys because of carrying on a family line, physical reason, and biased social recognition of men. First of all, the fact that boys carry on a family line when they grow up makes parents prefer boys. One of the basic desires of humans is keeping their family by producing offspring. In many countries, women follow their husband's last name when they get married. Also, married women are considered a member of their husband's family. Therefore, parents want to have a son who will continue their family. The second reason is that men are physically stronger than women. Traditionally, men have worked for his family, such as hunting, planting whereas women tended to stay at home and take care of their children. It can be attributed to the fact that men are more efficient to work because of their physical strength. Especially, tendency of preference of boy is strong in agricultural societies because physical strength is directly connected to productivity.

Even we can see the changes of people' thoughts: the preference for boys. Nowadays, many parents prefer to have male children. If we simply think about this, this situation can be considered just a happening. However, if we investigate this seriously, we can know that there are several reasons that parents want to have male children rather than female children. To prevent inequality of the sex resulting from this problem, the government should be struggle for reducing the crimes of the kidnap of female children and eliminating discrimination against women.
First of all, the crimes related to the kidnap of female children can be mentioned. While the world was changed quickly, some people could not afford to follow these changes. These people decided to commit crimes, almost giving up their lives. For instance, one month ago, a crime occurred in South Korea. A man kidnapped a female child and killed her. This crime made most parents in South Korea scared. In most kidnaps, crimers target young and female children so that parents prefer to have male children and even more they don't want to have any children. 
Second, The discrimination against women still exists in workplace. Even though many women work outside, most high classes are occupied by men. That is, women are limited in the class of the workplace. We can see this situation around South Korea. Although female students get a better grade in tests and experience much more than male students, it is harder for them to get a better job because most companies prefer male workers. Therefore, the parents who want their children to get a better job prefer to have male children.
Finally, Unlike the U.S. South Korea has the culture that the oldest son will live with parents, when they are not enough to live by themselves.
In conclusion, the government should treat with this problem seriously by introducing the policies, which prohibit the discrimination against women in workplace, and by making people feel comfortable to have female children.","With the development of technologies, communications, science and so on around the world, numerous changes have occurred.

 Many people would agree that gambling is a problem that not only affects the people who are addicted to it and theirs families, but all society. People who share this point of view think that gambling is associated with crimes. They believe gamblers are involved in murders and drugs. Another common stereotype is that gambling earnings fund terrorist acts and help drug dealers to do money laundry. These hypotheses aren't that far from reality and in my opinion they are the reason that should motivate governments to legalize gambling. The legalization will allow the government more control over this activity and most importantly over the funds transaction generated for these activities. 

 For a better control over gamblers and gambling's funds the government should invest on the creation of new laws and the creation of a new organism to applied them. Many politicians think that the cost of creating this organism would be a problem, but in fact, It wouldn't be, because if the government can control the movements it can charge a sort of taxes over it in order to cover the Spence's of the new law implementation. 

 The control over gambling would allow the governments to identify gamblers, to allow regular prayer to enjoy themselves and to control those problematic players, by denying them the privilege to play or by informing their help group if they were to be subscribed to some. It would be also a way to keep teenagers away from this activity and from the environment that is usually associated. 

 Another problem of gambling now a day is that people don't always no with whom they are playing, so some wealthy investors play against terrorist with out knowing that their fun evening is funding terrorist activity. If all players would be survey, and all money for gambling would be survey, this money wouldn't get into the wrong hands.

 Finally gambling in a control face environment is a very profitable for casinos, and fun for tourist. It should not be penalize, it just should be controlled in order to avoid teenager to think of this activity as a way of earning easy money. Legalizing the activity would also help diminish the criminal rate by controlling gamblers who play with out having funds and get in trouble.","Many people would agree that gambling is a problem that not only affects the people who are addicted to it and theirs families, but all society.

I think that it is necessary to travel to the country where the language is spoken in order to truly learn the language, because traveling helps you improve your second language rapidly and learn the second language truly.

First, traveling helps you improve your second language. For example, English is my second language. I have studied English more than ten years. I already studied grammar, writing, reading, listening and speaking, but I could not speak English when I first came to the US. I could not even understand that the cashier said when I went shopping. Day by day, I realized that my listening improved quickly. Also, I started to speak English gradually. 

Second, traveling helps you truly learn language. When you travel to the foreign country, you get know their culture first-hand. It helps you learn the language the natural way. You will take part in many activities to learn the language. You can take the foreign language class. Your teacher is a native speaker, he/she can correct you when you make mistakes, and give you explanation until you understand. On the other hand, you can learn something else, you have never learnt in your own country. When I first heard ""what is up?"". I did not understand the meaning, I just rise up my head to look at the sky. Later, I got the meaning. I made mistake first but I learnt from the real language situation. 

I agree that people say traveling to learn the foreign language is too expensive. You need to pay lots for your travel ticket, lodgings, food and tuition. However, traveling to the foreign country to learn their language may be the best way. It is also a good opportunity to improve your foreign language skills.

In conclusion, I hope you change your mind to think about a way to learn a language. It is evident that traveling to the foreign country to learn their foreign language is a natural and efficient way. Do not hesitate, just try it if you can afford.

However, traveling to the foreign country to learn their language may be the best way. It is also a good opportunity to improve your foreign language skills. In conclusion, I hope you change your mind to think about a way to learn a language. It is evident that traveling to the foreign country to learn their foreign language is a natural and efficient way. Do not hesitate, just try it if you can afford. ",3,

 Learning a second language can be one of the most fun and interesting experiences. Today there are numerous languages in the world. Some people think that you can learn another language in your own country. In each language, there are many words that you cannot learn if you do not go to the country of the spoken language. Consequently, traveling to another country to learn another language is necessary because it can give you the experience and opportunity to practice all the time and learn idioms or slang that you cannot learn in the region where you grew up.

 One of the principle reasons is that if you stay in the country where you live, you cannot practice in normal situations. There are many words that you use in normal life situations. That is why it is important to be in the country of the language that you want to learn and have different interactions with native speakers. In my own experience, it was not until I came to the U.S. and lived for a period of time that I learned things that I never learned studying English in my country. I learned all this because I practiced all the time, when I went to the store, in school, in the market, in my house, and with my friends. You cannot do this in your country.
 
 The second important thing that you have to consider is that in every language there are idioms, or slang. If you are not in the country of the spoken language, you cannot learn idioms or slang. Many times I have experienced friends saying some words that I never heard before, because I never learned them in school in my own country. These are some idioms, or slang, that I have learned since I moved to the U.S.: ain't-isn't, hit the road-let's go, give me some slack-do not be hard on me, break a leg-good luck.
 

 I understand that some people do not incorporate traveling into their lives, but they are very interested in learning a new language. Some people think that if you go to a good school or a good program in your country, you can learn in an excellent way. However, you are never going to have all the vocabulary of a native speaker, and you are not going to have all the experience to practice wherever you go in normal life situations. Consequently, you are not going to be a 100% speaker in another language.
 
 There are things that you are not going to learn if you do not go to the country of the language that you want to learn.

By far, electricity is applied in anywhere. When we open our eyes, how many gadgets need to consume electricity. I have a ninety nine of percent confidence to say every gadget tough. Also, electricity could be quite rather than oil by car one day. Electric cars would diminish air pollution and improve milieu.

 First of all, electricity casts an important character at night. We know that light bowl brings us brightness at night. However, if light bowl is without electricity, there is no light. It's obvious that when we are at outside without light in dark, we cannot reach out somewhere. From a perspective of the electricity suddenly braking down in a city is appalling and spooky at night. We can hear a few citizens are yelling or screaming. Also, there is no traffic light at that time. Then, what a ton of cars are stuck on any roads, and the traffic has totally paralyzed. That is a horrible thing. So, we cannot lack electricity at night because we have to have that. 

 Secondly, without electricity there is very inconvenient in modern life. There are many electric appliances in our house. They have the same common that has been provided electricity because they are electric machines. If electric machines are electricity cut down, we have to spend` much time to do something by hands. That is so tiresome. The wash machine is apparently an example. Usually, a wash machine takes approximately 30 minutes to make cloths be clean. Unfortunately, the machine doesn't work some days because of out of electricity. We have to wash amounts of family cloths by hand. Also, we have to do those actions by ourselves to soak cloths, to rub cloths, to scrub, and to wring. Those movements are complex and inconvenient. So, those appliances need electricity on duty. Otherwise, to do some house workings is inopportune.

 Finally, electricity can be fuel for cars that is more efficiency and more green. Since the crude oil index was over one hundred dollars, many developed countries are seeking instead of energy for cars. Moreover, emission waste gas from cars that is not only harmful of human breath system, but also is causing damage for the global. Nowadays, electric cars are more and more popular in the world. Also, the car is consuming electricity. There are several of advantages on electric cars. No emission waste gas is from electric cars. Most of electricity is changing to energy and going thought wheels. There is not necessary to change oil for an engine. Therefore, it is time to change a car which is consuming electricity is more advanced and more saved. 

 To sum up, humans certainly rely on electricity. We cannot live without electricity. Electricity is providing brightness at night. Electricity supply appliances power, and make anything be easier. Green is our future because air pollution has to diminish in environment. Therefore, electricity has not been lacking right now even future.

Usually, a wash machine takes approximately 30 minutes to make cloths be clean. Unfortunately, the machine doesn't work some days because of out of electricity. We have to wash amounts of family cloths by hand. Also, we have to do those actions by ourselves to soak cloths, to rub cloths, to scrub, and to wring. Those movements are complex and inconvenient. So, those appliances need electricity on duty. Otherwise, to do some house workings is inopportune. Finally, electricity can be fuel for cars that is more efficiency and more green. Since the crude oil index was over one hundred dollars, many developed countries are seeking instead of energy for cars. Moreover, emission waste gas from cars that is not only harmful of human breath system, but also is causing damage for the global. Nowadays, electric cars are more and more popular in the world. Also, the car is consuming electricity. There are several of advantages on electric cars. No emission waste gas is from electric cars. Most of electricity is changing to energy and going thought wheels. There is not necessary to change oil for an engine. Therefore, it is time to change a car which is consuming electricity is more advanced and more saved. To sum up, humans certainly rely on electricity. We cannot live without electricity. Electricity is providing brightness at night. Electricity supply appliances power, and make anything be easier. Green is our future because air pollution has to diminish in environment. Therefore, electricity has not been lacking right now even future. ","Can we picture that if one day we are without electricity in our current life? The answer is easily to shout out that is appalling. By far, electricity is applied in anywhere. When we open our eyes, how many gadgets need to consume electricity. I have a ninety nine of percent confidence to say every gadget tough. Also, electricity could be quite rather than oil by car one day. Electric cars would diminish air pollution and improve milieu. First of all, electricity casts an important character at night. We know that light bowl brings us brightness at night. However, if light bowl is without electricity, there is no light. It's obvious that when we are at outside without light in dark, we cannot reach out somewhere. From a perspective of the electricity suddenly braking down in a city is appalling and spooky at night. We can hear a few citizens are yelling or screaming. Also, there is no traffic light at that time. Then, what a ton of cars are stuck on any roads, and the traffic has totally paralyzed. That is a horrible thing. So, we cannot lack electricity at night because we have to have that. Secondly, without electricity there is very inconvenient in modern life. There are many electric appliances in our house. They have the same common that has been provided electricity because they are electric machines. If electric machines are electricity cut down, we have to spend` much time to do something by hands. That is so tiresome. The wash machine is apparently an example.

Y,K3511,46051,ec1,Korean,Female,989,4,w,5865,1,506,499,499," 100 years ago, we couldn't imagine using the phone on the street but nowadays, we almost never see adults who are not using their cell phone. This invention is the most beneficial for humanity that has been made on last 10 years and many people prefer using this item for their life. The effects of the cell phone on our life are being able to make mobile communication, to provide a variety of uses, and to use it for our safety.
 First of all, people can remove the limitation of places for communication by using the cell phone. In the past, people had to stay in their home to call somebody because the phone was needed to connect with the line for getting signal and electricity. However, in the present, people can call everyone on the street, in the school, and in the bus if they can get signal to connect the cell phone. For instance, when people have a car accident, the cell phone enables them to get in touch with their insurance company to solve the problem on the street. If we don't have the cell phone at this moment, we will feel very uncomfortable to contact with police officers and the insurance company to report the accident.
 Secondly, the cell phone can be used for many purposes. These days, people can buy various cell phones from 2G mobile phone for calling only to the smart phone for using the Internet. They can use them not only to have a conversation with friends or family by calling but also to search for the fastest route to go the destination by the Internet. These help us to keep relationship with others and to find lots of information when we need. Moreover, we can take a photo and listen to music through the cell phone. If people forget to bring their cell phone in the morning, they may experience some inconvenience. 
 Thirdly, the cell phone helps people to keep their safety. In my opinion, the most beneficial moment to use it is to call the police when people experience crime. For example, to call 911 fast is really significant to prevent shooters from making a lot of victims in a serious shooting incident. If people have the cell phone at this moment, they can report crime to the police as soon as possible. Also, the police officers can pursue somebody's location to find them in a kid napping crime by tracing location of the cell phone. Sometimes, it is a great clue to find somebody.
 In the conclusion, the mobile phone is a useful thing to communicate with others without limitation of the place, to use it for multipurpose, and to live safely. According to pass time, people can see incredible advancements of the cell phone like being small size and using the Internet. I believe that the cell phone will bring us to more advantages in the future and it will be more necessary things for our life.
