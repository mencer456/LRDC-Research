(CNN) -- The price of a gallon of gasoline has jumped back up near $3 a gallon, according to a survey published Sunday.

The Lundberg Survey found the average price for a gallon of self-serve regular was $2.96 on Friday, up 16 cents from the previous survey two weeks earlier.

If crude oil prices don't retreat, gas prices could easily cross back over the $3 mark on average, said publisher Trilby Lundberg.

Prices reached an all-time high of $3.18 in May.

The current price, $2.96, is 78 cents higher than it was one year ago, Lundberg said.

The survey looks at thousands of gas stations across the country. It found the highest average price for a gallon of self-serve regular was in San Francisco, at $3.28. The lowest was in Newark, New Jersey, at $2.73.",1

2892,2,"The Miracle of Green Tea

""Better to be deprived of food for three days, than tea for one."" (Ancient Chinese Proverb)

Is any other food or drink reported to have as many health benefits as green tea? The Chinese have known about the medicinal benefits of green tea since ancient times, using it to treat everything from headaches to depression.  In her book Green Tea: The Natural Secret for a Healthier Life, Nadine Taylor states that green tea has been used as a medicine in China for at least 4,000 years. 

Today, scientific research in both Asia and the west is providing hard evidence for the health benefits long associated with drinking green tea. For example, in 1994 the Journal of the National Cancer Institute published the results of an epidemiological study indicating that drinking green tea reduced the risk of esophageal cancer in Chinese men and women by nearly sixty percent. University of Purdue researchers recently concluded that a compound in green tea inhibits the growth of cancer cells. There is also research indicating that drinking green tea lowers total cholesterol levels, as well as improving the ratio of good (HDL) cholesterol to bad (LDL) cholesterol.

To sum up, here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful:

cancer
rheumatoid arthritis
high cholesterol levels
cariovascular disease
infection
impaired immune function

What makes green tea so special? 

The secret of green tea lies in the fact it is rich in catechin polyphenols, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG is a powerful anti-oxidant: besides inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, it kills cancer cells without harming healthy tissue. It has also been effective in lowering LDL cholesterol levels, and inhibiting the abnormal formation of blood clots.  The latter takes on added importance when you consider that thrombosis (the formation of abnormal blood clots) is the leading cause of heart attacks and stroke.

Links are being made between the effects of drinking green tea and the ""French Paradox."" For years, researchers were puzzled by the fact that, despite consuming a diet rich in fat, the French have a lower incidence of heart disease than Americans. The answer was found to lie in red wine, which contains resveratrol, a polyphenol that limits the negative effects of smoking and a fatty diet.  In a 1997 study, researchers from the University of Kansas determined that EGCG is twice as powerful as resveratrol, which may explain why the rate of heart disease among Japanese men is quite low, even though approximately seventy-five percent are smokers.

Why don't other Chinese teas have similar health-giving properties? Green, oolong, and black teas all come from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. What sets green tea apart is the way it is processed.  Green tea leaves are steamed, which prevents the EGCG compound from being oxidized. By contrast, black and oolong tea leaves are made from fermented leaves, which results in the EGCG being converted into other compounds that are not nearly as effective in preventing and fighting various diseases.",1

The Inconsistency of Language Rights in the United States 
 
By James Crawford 
 
In the spring of 2006, after a decade in remission, the campaign for ?Official English? flared up again in the Congress of the United States. An amendment to immigration legislation, passed by the Senate on May 18, designated English as the ?national 
language.? More significantly, the measure sought to restrict access to government in other languages:  

""Unless otherwise authorized or provided by law, no person has a right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the United States or any of its officials or representatives act, communicate, perform or provide services, or provide materials in any language other than English. If exceptions are made, that 
does not create a legal entitlement to additional services in that language or any language other than English.""
 
1.  What is the main idea of this paragraph?",1
2955,2,"Senator James Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who sponsored the amendment, argued that it was necessary to clarify to immigrants their responsibility to learn the English language, adding (somewhat contradictorily) that the importance of learning English was already recognized by the vast majority of foreign-born Americans. Only ?extremist groups? would be ?offended? by the idea of banning most language rights for ethnic minorities, he asserted. In any case, Inhofe said, U.S. courts had consistently ruled ?that civil rights laws protecting against national origin ? discrimination do not create rights 
to Government services and materials in languages other than English.""

2.  What does Senator Inhofe believe is the responsibility of each citizen of the US?

3.  Why does the author put the words ""extremist groups"" and ""offended"" in quotes?",1
2956,2,"Rising in opposition, Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, warned that the amendment would deprive many U.S. residents of rights and services that they would otherwise enjoy if not for the language barrier. By prohibiting bilingual accommodations at government?s discretion, Durbin argued, Congress would ? in effect ? authorize discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities, breaking with long-established legal principles.

I have a big dilemma!  My boyfriend just moved to Minnesota, which is halfway across the country, for his new job.  We have only been going out for 4 months, but I think I am in love with him.  I did not tell my boyfriend how I feel.  I know that he really likes me, but I don't think that he loves me...yet.   Right before he left, he told me that I should visit him.  I really I want to visit him, but he hasn't mentioned anything about that since he moved.  In fact, I have only spoken to him once since he moved -- which was over a week ago!  I have a good job and am earning quite a lot of money, but I am sooo unhappy without my boyfriend!  What should I do?  Should I visit him and hope that he asks me to move there to be with him?  Or should I just quit my job and move there without looking back?  Please give me your advice.

Dear Chatty,

I have a big dilemma!  My boyfriend just moved to Minnesota, which is halfway across the country, for his new job.  We have only been going out

Dear Chatty,

I have a big dilemma!  My boyfriend just moved to Minnesota, which is halfway across the country, for his new job.  We have only been going out for 4 months, but I think I am in love with him.

Social issue: marriage equality

     Most men and women enter into the union of marriage at some point during their lifetime. Marriage is often sanctioned primarily through a religious institution, but must also be sanctioned by the government so that the couple (or group in some cases) can be legally recognized. Legal recognition of ""marital status"" is important for financial incentives, such as tax breaks, but it can also have bearing on more serious situations, such as who is able to enter a hospital and make decisions on a person's behalf in the event of serious injury.  Marriage equality is a term used by the LGBT community to name the current movement to push back against government exclusion of gays and lesbians from entering into legal marriage. Those who oppose ""marriage equality,"" think that (presumably Christian) basic religious requirements for marriage should equate to basic government requirements?namely that marriage should only occur between a man and a woman. However, the majority of Americans view this ""anti-marriage equality"" position on marriage as leading to biased and unnecessary regulation and an intrusion of church into state. 
     Yet, the government has been prone to controversial and contested regulations of marriage for many years. Currently, in most states you have to take a blood test to prove that you are not marrying someone in your immediate family before a marriage license is issued. Your ""immediate"" family includes not only your parents and siblings, but also your first cousins. Cousin-marriage was practiced by many American aristocratic families well into the 19th century. Also in the 19th century, particularly after the rise of Mormonism, polygamy was banned. Those who practiced Mormonism were forced to move to the frontier lands of Utah in order to engage in marriage as defined by their culture and religion. Finally, until the mid to late 20th century, African Americans were legally forbidden to marry white Americans. In my opinion, government regulation of marriage often reflects a larger social concern with, or bias against, particular categories of people. The debate over marriage equality, or the right for gay men and women to marry a same-sex partner, has brought this seemingly mundane legal process once again to the fore as an issue of equality and human rights.",1

Then all the chinks and pores in the walls were sealed with putty. After the putty had had a chance to dry, the exterior could be painted. A latex paint was used because it is easy to apply and cleans up with water. A whole week was needed to finish this part of the job. I was very careful to apply the paint evenly because I did not want to have to apply two coats. A color was used that was very close to the original color. Our house is a two-story house, which meant that a tall ladder was needed to do the second story. The paint can had to be balanced on the top rung of the ladder while I worked.

6038,2,"After World War II, Europe was the center of important developments in filmmaking.  This strongly influenced motion pictures worldwide.  In Italy, well-known movies started a trend towards realism in film. One of these films was Rossellini's Open City, which was made in 1945.  Another film was De Sica's The Bicycle Thief.  It was made in 1948.  These directors took their cameras into the streets.  Most of them preferred not to use artificial stories to spice up plots for entertainment.  They wanted to make films which showed the real difficulties of life in the years after the war.
     In the next decades, Federico Fellini combined realistic plots with philosophical ideas.  He was an outstanding director.  His films are now classics.  His most famous film is La Strada.  La Strada is a movie that seems to be about circus people in the streets but really is about the meaning of life.
     In France, a group of young filmmakers appeared during the 1950s.  They were called the ""New Wave"".  Their focus was people.  This group developed a new kind of film which stressed psychology instead of plot. It featured new camera and acting techniques.  We can see many of these techniques in movies such as Truffaut's 400 Blows.
     In England, another group of filmmakers developed a new kind of realism.  They were known as the ""Angry Young Man"" movement.  In Sweden, Ingmar Bergman used simple stories and fables to look at complex philosophical and social topics.  Some of these topics are expertly explored in The Seventh Seal.  The Spaniard Luis Bunuel portrayed social injustices. His impressive film Viridiana made him famous.
     Postwar developments in filmmaking did not take place only in Western Europe.  There was significant influence from Asian filmmakers, like Satyajit Ray.  His movie Pather Panchali showed us life on the subcontinent of Asia and became well known.  Even in Russia, where filmmaking was under state control, it was possible to make movies like The Cranes Are Flying.  This movie shows the problems which individuals suffered.
     In summary, after World War II, there were types of movies on the scene telling different kinds of stories.  These stories were made by new filmmakers who were from around the world.",1

I could study in San Francisco, but I'm afraid of earthquakes and there could potentially be a major earthquake there any time. Alternatively, I could go to Pittsburgh, but I've heard that the region experiences severely cold winters and stifling hot summers.  There are many other factors to consider, such as the professional sports teams, the cuisine, the friendliness of the people, and the cost of living.  I'm writing both you in Pittsburgh and students at another ELI in San Francisco to get your perspectives.  Please give me your advice based on your experience of living in Pittsburgh.
