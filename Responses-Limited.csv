I agree that some schools limit student's computer labs time to prevent them from Webaholism.The internet is a very popular communication tool in the modern time. Many young people use it to make new friends, search for new information , and do homework. It is convenient for people to save much time and money. 
On the other hand, many people waste much time on the internet to do useless things. For example,some students spend much time on playing on-line games and forget to do their homework. In addition, they have many problems in psychologic and mental. They can't make friends in real world, and don't care about their family anymore. Some medical research reports said, if you use computer for a long time, you must take a rest every 30 mins or you will get heart attach or other diseases , but most people don't ignore this.

Thus, Schools are educational places. They need to push students to do right things and direct them to do useful activities.They can't spend too much time on the internet if it's not necessary. Therefore, school should limit student's computer labs times.Students also realize that the internet just a kind of tool and not your whole life. They must go outside and reaction with friends and family in real world. They will have healthier psychology and mind.","I agree that some schools limit student's computer labs time to prevent them from Webaholism.The internet is a very popular communication tool in the modern time.

Different people have different definitions of success. For instance, my friend and I have different definition of success. In my case, getting fame in my job is the most important thing for success. Getting fame in my job means I become an expert in my job. I'd like to make Korean sports industry improve and make important decisions for it.

 On the other hand, my friend thinks making a lot of money is the most important thing for success. He thinks making a lot of money can help him succeed many things like his children's education problems or his parents' health problems. For instance, he says if he doesn't have enough money, he can't do anything when his parents get sick unless he is a doctor. That's just a kind of reason he prefers making money.

 The difference of success for each person

 The definition of success differs for each 

person. Each person has his/her own opinion or 

condition from special experience or problems. 

For example, some of my friends think that 

the most important thing to success is the 

money. One of these friends has had bad 

condition in his family because they had some 

financial problems every time. So he always 

emphasizes the importance of money. And for my 

parents, health and peaceful family is the most

important thing. Because some of their brothers 

and sisters didn't have good health condition, 

or had big problems with their family. So, what 

I want to say is that the definition of success 

is different for each person because of their 

own reasons.

 For me, my own definition of success is to 

enjoy my job. Enjoying something is a essential 

factor of one's life. When I was young, I 

enjoyed playing video games, baseball and 

soccer. I was happy because there is something I 

can do what I want to do. Now, I'm studying for 

my future and I have to get a job. I choose my 

major that I can enjoy. If I feel happy for 

enjoying my job, the money, peaceful family and 

something more will come together, I believe.

A successful person needs to have special conditions to be successful. I think certain conditions are important for success. Some of these conditions are charisma, good work ethic, positive thinking, leadership skills and luck. First one is charisma. Person should have a challenging mind and spirit. This along with charisma, a person has attractive power. Second is hard work. If a person doesn't make a good effort at something, the person can't be rewarded. Therefore, he can't be successful. Third is positive thinking. A successful person must always think 'I can do it'. If a person thinks negatively then he can't achieve, because negative thoughts cause hesitation which hinders success. Fourth is leadership skill. Without leadership skills, no matter how much talent a person has others will not rely on the person. Others will not see the person talents. Fifth is luck. If a person has all these conditions and more, but doesn't have luck then the person may never find an opportunity which will make the person's successful.
In short, a person who want to be successful and then special conditions are correct and do they the best in every mission, they just might have a chance at finding success.

Y,S37,2596,gx0,Spanish,Male,171,4,w,304,1,249,234,234,"First of all, success is considered an achievement

of goals. It varies from culture to culture and 

defines a specific talent. For instance, an 

individual can succeed at work, in the family, 

between friends, in a championship, etc. Of 

course, there are some factors to consider that 

facilitates the reaching of success such as 

economic wealth, work positions, family business, 

social influences, etc. That's the reason why I 

think success is an achievement beyond our regular 

capacities.


Second, succeeding needs effort, effort needs time 

and time is the big disadvantage of success, 

because during that time we leave apart other 

activities (work, family, friends, hobbies, etc.). 

In other words, it's almost impossible to succeed 

in everything. Normally a person is better in one 

aspect than the others and by focusing in the 

primary talent it's common to neglect secondary 

ones. Complementing, success sacrifices time. Time 

able to be used to equilibrate all the areas in 

the day-life of an individual.


To conclude, I believe success has a sociologic 

aspect. It's a proof of what an individual can do 

what is he willing to risk in manner to show our 

superiority as human beings. The society obligates 

the individual to compete for him to succeed. This 

can be related to a social and instinctive 

behavior of survival. Social because it only takes 

place in the society and instinctive because 

competing it's part of our nature.

So, if I do that, I usually don`t erase the words, I just change the paper. And also, if I study something, I usually use the eraser. Because, it`s very fast. During the study, time is very important. I have to fast if I`m possibility. Second, I want to study at bright place, and I also want enough that as much as teacher`s desk in my classroom area. For example, Iin the dark place or room, I can`t see that I want. It makes that my feeling is not good. When I start the study, my desk is usually very clean. But, at the finish time, my desk is very messy. So, my best study place is a classroom : many desks in the room give me enough place to work. A fluorescent light in the room helps me, too. Therefore, I always try to make this place and search like this.

The economics in China is growing recently, thus the living standard in China will become better than before. This is an important part which can attract foreigners come and have a visit. China is also a country with long history, some architectures or antiques may also attract tourists. 

 Besides the economics element, the security also plays an important role in attracting tourists. Since many security problems happened in the world, there are much more tourists they consider the security than before. If there is a war in the country, it must reduce the will of tourists to travel there.

However, the economics in East Asia/Pacific is not as good as in the 20th century. The economics in those countries tend to grow slower than before.

The most three important things of my life are family life, friends' relationship and career. I grew up in a lovely family. All of the members of my family are humble and honest. My parents are conceded our family education more than school grade. Thus keeping well relationship between us is one of the most significant issues of my family even though we do not live together. As I know many siblings of a family have a big competition to each other, but among our siblings, we don't have any competition during our school education. In other hand, each of our siblings is as a back up to each one. So if someone gets trouble, others would do they best to help to him/ her. For example I am here, U.S.A. and applying schools. When I need a lot of something I always ask my sibling to help me to look for me, they always put them in the first priority. Moreover, I have had a lot of friends who helped me during my life. I think without their help, I could not do as much as I can and have a pleasant school life and enjoyable worked experiences. For instance, when first day I came here, I felt a little anxious to be here. My friend who picked me up at airport gave me a lot of suggestions how to live here. Now I can survive here. Thus the friendship is very important thing for me in my life. Furthermore, a successful career is indispensable to my life. It is not only for making a lot of money but also something to contribute your family, society and community. So that is why I am continuing to learn and update my knowledge of my filed.

It could be different from each person because we have our own thoughts and ideas. These threes could be in among the top 10. The first one is 'Positive Mind'. Whenever we do something, for example, doing important homework or doing a project, the way of thinking is one of things which make our work success. Although it seems to be fail or wrong, sometimes, it turns into the success only have the positive mind. Of curse, you have to do your best doing your job. The second one is 'Relationship with People'. We have relationships with family, friends, colleagues, and even the members of some small social club.

They might need different amount of water. I think that friendship is a relationship that emphasizes sharing your innermost feeling. It usually needs to take care a feeling which is happy or sad between you and your friend. Friendship looks like a fresh plant which needs you to look after it everyday. 

 How do you cultivate and develop your friendship? I have a best friend, who is a good teacher, works in my country. Six years ago, I met her in my office when she just began to join our team. Soon, we ware good friends. Maybe we had same personalities that I preferred to talk someone whether s/he is a male or a female, I could get a friend; she could talk into strangers in a party or in a meeting, then she got some friends quickly. We often shared our feeling of excitation or worry. For example, I had health trouble when I was feeling down. She spent a lot of time to see a doctor with me. When I was treated by a hospital, she always saw me at the hospital which was so far from her home in her free time, and I really thanked her. I also knew that progressing friendship is each other. One day, I saw her very annoying; I asked her why she was sad. She told me that her son got a sick at their house alone, nobody took care for him. She had a whole day's classes, and couldn't stay home. I quickly checked my schedule, and just had one class, then told her not to worry. After my class, I went her home with her son. Today, we often call each other on the phone.

 I am a student at the EFL Computer Training Institute. My classes are very good, but the Institute had better make some improvements or many students are going to leave. Excuse me for my advices, but I think you should clean the classroom, and you should empty the trash. After you should repair the ceiling, you ought to paint the wall, and you should change the window. I think if you make this many students aren't going to leave, and maybe another students are coming to EFL. 
 Maybe you had better repair the photocopier, and you had better buy new computers. Because the student shouldn't wait in the classroom, that another student finish to use the computer. Finally I think the students shouldn't eat and drink in the classroom, because this is very dirty and they can damage the computers.

 Thank you, for read my letter.

Many parents try to move famous local districts which promote a lot of competition. Korean education has generated a lot of problems in the university entrance system because Korean parents and teachers have a strong passion to education for their children and they believe that entering the best university is the way to success.

First of all, an ideal education should be without grades. For that reason, I think a good idea could be that each kid grades her/his work. If they evaluate their own work they can notice if they are right or wrong without feeling worry about how others judge what they are doing; as the author states in the passage. Second, teachers and parents should give kids more freedom and permit them to play or do activities that they really enjoy. As a consequence, kids will develop their creativity, originality and skills. Third, education should be not only knowledge but also recreation and fun activities for kids. As a consequence the ideal education should integrate the principal areas of knowledge such as: math, science, etc. with activities that permit kids to learn faster and not traumatically. Finally, parents and teachers should leave kids to manage their own time; parents could provide them a big schedule and post it in the wall of the kid's room. Therefore, children can establish their activities and control their own time. In conclusion and according to the author ideas, I think that an ideal education setting will be less strict and more flexible and fun. Teachers and parents should understand that is more easy to children learn while they are playing than learn when they are worried.","According to the author, an ideal education setting would like totally different as is today.

 Here are two reasons. There are Dell E1405 and Dell E1505 notebooks. I change first one is A and the other one is B. The cost of the A is $799 and the B is $899. The B is more expensive than the A $100. The colors are both black and silver gray. I like this color very much.

 First of all, cost is very important me. ""Play Station 3"" is more expensive than ""X-Box 360"". Actually, ""Play Station 3"" is about $700. On the other hand, ""X-Box 360"" is just $400. If I consider the cost, of course I will buy ""X-Box 360"". But, you know that ""Play Station 3"" has excellent graphic. It's better than ""X-Box 360"". In addition, Many game CD companies follow the ""Sony"", such as ""God of war"", ""Final Fantasy"", and other games. Of course, other game CD companies also follow the ""MS"".

I recently broke my laptop, so I want to buy one. I choose already two things. Which kind of laptop do I buy? I hope that you give me advice. I will explain you theirs.

 Frist, one thing is Pavilion notebook made from HP. Its moniter size is 14.1 inch. And price is $779.99. Its facility is not bad. Memory is 1024MB and hard driver is 120GB. I think its price is good. Memory is good, but computer processing speed is not good. And then hard driver's size is not enough. Second, other thing is Satellite notebook made from TOSHIBA. Its moniter size is 17 inch. I like big size, but it is heavy either. And then price is $1299.99. It is more expensive than Pavilion, but its facility is better than Pavilion. Memory is 2048MB and hard driver is 160GB. Because memory is very good, computer processing speed is very fast. And then hard driver's size is similar with Pavilion. 


 I will consider buying computer carefully. If you recommend one thing, I will be more easy to choose one thing. I think most important thing is facility, so I like more Satellite. But price is important either. I don't know whether I buy Pavilion or other.

Dear Jaegeun,

I have a plan to buy a new digital camera, because my former digital camera is broken why I dropped it into water . I know that it was a too silly mistake so I regretted my mistake too much. But you know that I will really need a digital camera to take a picture when I travel to any other cities or countries after this semester. So I decide that I will buy a new camera. I went to shopping mall to look for a camera what is adequate for me, and I selected two products.
I consider buying either Sony DSC-W55 or HP-R927. So I compared their differences. First, DSC-W55, its cost is $200, is chipper than the cost of HP-R927 what is $300. Actually I have enough money to buy anyone. But I think that buying the first one is more economical than buying second one.
Second, I compared design of both DSC-W55 and R927. In fact, when I saw their designs, I couldn't find large differences between DSC-W55 and R927. They have the colors of silver and similar weights, so they almost look like same model. They only have small difference about LCD screen size, because DSC-W55 has a 2.5"" LCD screen but R927 has a 3"" screen. But I think that this difference is not an important problem to take pictures.
Third, they have just little differences about their feature. DSC-W55 has 3x optical zoom, 7.5 mega pixels for picture quality, and a 56 mega bites of internal memory. In contrast, R927 has 3x optical zoom, 8.2 mega pixels for picture quality, and a 35 mega bites of internal memory. So they have same optical zoom ability and little differences about picture quality and internal memory. But anyhow I need an extra memory chip, because both of internal memories are too small to keep many pictures, so capacity of ineternal memory is not important to choose a digital camera. And both of picture qualities also don't have large difference.
As a result, I decide to buy a DSC-W55 when I compared both of them. If you have other opinions about buying digital camera or you know other digital camera which has better condition than DSC-W55, please tell me about the digital camera.

Sincerely,

Dear Irene,

How are you?. I'm well, but my computer broke, because of that I'm going to buy a new 


computer, and I need it for my job. Yesterday I went shopping to the Best Buy and I saw two 


good computers.


They have the same name but Gateway computer A and Gateway computer B are different in 


many ways. 


-First, the Gateway computer A is cheaper than the Gateway computer B because the 


Gateway computer A costs $ 599,99 and Gateway computer B costs $ 699,99.


-Second, the Gateway computer A is smaller than the Gateway computer B because the 


Gateway computer A has 14.1"" screen and Gateway computer has 17"" screen. 


However, they are alike in several ways. Gateway computer A and Gateway computer B 


have the same special features options. For example, memory, hard drive, reads and writes dual- 


layer DVDs and CDs, integrated 802.11g wireless LAN.


I would like to buy the Gateway computer B. I like it, because the screen is bigger than 


Gateway computer A, but it has a disadvantage because it is more expensive than the Gateway 


computer A. I don't know what I should do. What do you think about these computers? Do you 


think the Gateway computer B is better than the Gateway computer A?. 

 I wait your answer.

They have the same name but Gateway computer A and Gateway computer B are different in many ways. -First, the Gateway computer A is cheaper than the Gateway computer B because the Gateway computer A costs $ 599,99 and Gateway computer B costs $ 699,99. -Second, the Gateway computer A is smaller than the Gateway computer B because the Gateway computer A has 14.1"" screen and Gateway computer has 17"" screen. However, they are alike in several ways. Gateway computer A and Gateway computer B have the same special features options. For example, memory, hard drive, reads and writes dual- layer DVDs and CDs, integrated 802.11g wireless LAN. I would like to buy the Gateway computer B. I like it, because the screen is bigger than Gateway computer A, but it has a disadvantage because it is more expensive than the Gateway computer A. I don't know what I should do. What do you think about these computers? Do you think the Gateway computer B is better than the Gateway computer A?. I wait your answer. Sincerely, ","Dear Irene, How are you?.

 Most college students' diets are not good for them. The foods at college are many kinds, but the problem is that most of the foods are too fat. Some of the students are too lazy to cook, and they eat at school, so they become fat. There are many college students' diets that have problems because the food is unhealthy and the prices are a bit expensive.
College has a lot of food, but it's unhealthy for students. The foods usually are fast food such as french fries, hamburgers, salad, sushi, soup, sandwiches, and pizza because the students don't want to wait long. Reuters ""Junk-food Diet Gives Students Scurvy."" 23 January 2003. The cafeteria chefs want to make the food delicious, so they put a lot of oil, cheese and salt in the food. We eat these things everyday, and it is very unhealthy for us. For example, my friend is a college student. He eats lunch at school almost everyday, and he rarely exercises. Six month ago, his weight was 140 pounds, but now it has changed to 170 pounds.
Also, the food prices at college are a bit expensive. In my opinion, some foods' prices at college are same as that I can buy more foods in the supermarket. Buying food at the supermarket is better than eating at school because the food is cheaper at the supermarket that we can save more money. For example, I can buy five pieces of bread and meat at the supermarket for the same price as I pay for hamburger in the cafeteria. Many other foods are similar, so buying food at the supermarket is a good way to save money.
College students' diets have some problems that are bad for them. Sometimes students are busy or have a lot of homework to do, so they just eat at school, but they still have to think about their health problem. Eating too much fast food will change their body shapes and make them fat. The diet problem is the most important thing that the college students have to consider.

Moreover, they usually don't want to spend their time cooking something. Instead, they want to spend their time hanging out with friends or studying more, which they consider more important than cooking. They might think that spending time and efforts for cooking is not useful or effective. But there are a couple of considerable advantages doing their own cooking. The diet of students who do their own cooking is pretty good for their health and takes less money than other way like having fast food everyday, even though it requires some time and effort to do.
First, college students who do their own cooking can get a healthier and more nutritious diet than with other choices like having fast food often. Generally, homemade food has more nutrition and less negative effect .substances. If students usually eat junk food like fast food or instant food, and it becomes a habit, there will be some serious problems with their health condition, because those kinds of food don't have enough essential nutrition and contain negative substances like MSG, trans-fat, and so on. An article on ANON_URLPAGE, ""Among the fast food problems is also low quality of the food. Fast food is so popular because it is inexpensive, you can get a satisfying meal under $5. Low price is just one more reason why we should think twice before eating fast food. It is usually made with cheap ingredients, including high fat meat, and foods that contain saturated fat, cholesterol. It lacks vitamins and minerals, which can be found in fruit and vegetables mostly"" (June 11, 2005). If college students try to use various kinds of vegetables and grains as much as possible in their meals while they are cooking, it's obvious that it will be helpful for their health.
Furthermore, the most important things is that by doing their own cooking, college students can save their money . For example, during the ELI life, I usually have had lunch outside with some friends almost everyday. Cost only for lunch was around $200~$250 a month. But if I have used this money to go to the market and buy some stuffs for doing my own cooking, I could have brought my healthy lunch, and it would have spent less money in a month. Most college students can't afford to spend their money for everything they want to do. So it is important for college student to save money, and then they can use that saved money wisely, like buying some clothes, shoes, bags, furniture, or going out for a great dinner with friends sometimes.
However, it's pretty hard for college students to try to begin doing their own cooking because it requires a lot of time and effort. Many students usually don't want to do their own cooking because of that reason. College students, the young people, tend to use their time and effort to have some fun or study subjects that they think are more interesting or important. They don't want to struggle with knives, scoops, pans and pots in the kitchen making some food which is not really familiar. In fact, it is not simple job to do their everyday cooking, even for our parents. They might have experienced so much trial and error and finally succeeded in achieving some well-made food. When college students want to have nice dishes, and try to cook something, they might get a headache even before starting to move to the kitchen.
In conclusion, even though college students who do their own cooking are required to spend much time and effort, that diet deserves a try for its advantages in health and the money saved. Maybe it won't be easy for college students to start making some food all by themselves. But if they invest their time and effort in a very useful skill for now and the future, it will be helpful for their lives, and they will be able to enjoy doing their wise works.","Many college students tend to visit fast food restaurants for their everyday meals because it's cheap, convenient and served quickly.

Veganism, an extension of the vegetarian diet, is considered an ""integral component of a cruelty-free lifestyle""(Vegan Action, 2007). The diet consists of getting protein and other nutrients from fruits, beans, grains and vegetables, and staying completely away from meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy products. Although many health benefits have been discovered in recent years, cost and accessibility make this diet difficult to follow.
Currently, many studies support the idea that the consumption of animal fat and proteins is the main cause for many lethal diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, heart diseases and obesity. Therefore, some people choose to follow a vegan diet for health reasons. And even when it seems almost impossible that all the fat and proteins found in animal products could also be found in plants and other sources, fat can be obtained from oil products, and legumes and grains provide, with a planned diet, the same protein amount as any meat product plus other vitamins and minerals. The vegan diet has been shown to be healthier than a diet, in which meat is involved. In other words, a person's life expectancy could be prolonged and his or her quality of life improved, if the person followed this lifestyle. 
However, although it looks like the top choice diet, it's not simple to stick with it. Fast food, meat, dairy and egg costs are notably cheaper than fruits and vegetables. For instance, organic oranges are sold for around $ 1.50 per lb., when a pound of a whole chicken costs $ 0.70. And what's more, it's very difficult to find a vegan restaurant or a vegan supermarket in, what is nowadays, a fast-food culture. A vegan life is expensive and requires access to a nearby market, which is becoming extinct in many U.S. cities.
The vegan diet is the result of the search to find a pure diet whose goal is to avoid the violation of animal rights and the most frequent diseases caused by poor nutrition. Veganism offers a healthy life-style, but demands a strength of will from the person following the diet because it's a diet which many just can't afford following.","Veganism, an extension of the vegetarian diet, is considered an ""integral component of a cruelty-free lifestyle""(Vegan Action, 2007).

For instance, organic oranges are sold for around $ 1.50 per lb., when a pound of a whole chicken costs $ 0.70. And what's more, it's very difficult to find a vegan restaurant or a vegan supermarket in, what is nowadays, a fast-food culture. A vegan life is expensive and requires access to a nearby market, which is becoming extinct in many U.S. cities. The vegan diet is the result of the search to find a pure diet whose goal is to avoid the violation of animal rights and the most frequent diseases caused by poor nutrition. Veganism offers a healthy life-style, but demands a strength of will from the person following the diet because it's a diet which many just can't afford following. ",2,

I agree on her opinion on the text except one. That is ""Do spent time getting to know someone. Exchanging e-mail before actually meeting."" I think that viewing profile on internet or one time e-mail exchange is enough to grasp someone before actually meeting. Internet is just a way to meet someone for the first time. If you wrote a true profile and sincere e-mail each other, real meeting is more helpful and essential to make a solid relationship.

 Even if he made a decision to study again, his family - especially his wife- can have a different opinion or disagreement about his decision.

If there is a person who rejects to live in abroad and he ignores the family member, it might be a big problem not to be controlled during studying period and family is not happy. There is a relationship to be handled carefully after starting study. That's a relationship between colleagues.

There have many kinds of pressures of being a student, not only for students who study in hometown, but also for students who study aboard. They have pressures from parents, attending to undergraduate or graduate school, and having a nice job in the future.

The pressure from parents is the most common pressure with students who study aboard. Most of the students don't have a job while they're studying, so their parents need to afford them money to live, buy food, and buy things for life and school. Those things cost a lot. Therefore parents would like their children to finish their education as fast as they can.

Attending to undergraduate or graduate school also has a lot of pressure. Most of the students would like to study in a better school, which means they need to spend lots of time for studying; taking quizzes and tests, so that they can attend the school they want. 

Having a nice job in the future has lots of pressure, too. Before you have a nice work, you need to finish the study and get a good degree. Otherwise you won't be accepted by a good company. It's also important for people who want to get married and have a family. If you don't have a job, then you can't have the ability to support your family.

It's true that students have many pressures. They need to take care of their grades , and make sure they can have a high score of the exam. They also need to clear their mind to decide what they are going to be in the future.

They are able to pursue high-salary job and afford to have a higher quality of their standards of living. Before they have ability to compete with associates, they might need to work hard on their education. School lives just like a small society; therefore, pressure exists not only in wage earners, but also in students. Pressure comes from limiting budget of education fee, getting along with teachers and classmates, and achieving their self-discipline.

Limiting budget is an obstacle for students and also brings pressure to students. For instance, some students really want to study, but their parents do not have enough money to pay for their education fee. Therefore, they might think about earning money by themselves. And then, they will face a dilemma of choosing studying or working. In addition, if students do not have enough money to pay for their education fee, we can assume that there are some problems in their families. In this kind of situation, how can students focus on schooling? Having the problem of paying education fee makes students have stress.

Having bad relationship with teachers and classmates is a kind of pressure to students. First of all, if students do not like their teachers, they might not want to pay attention to instruction or take classes, because they do not want to face to their odious teachers. On the other hand, if students cannot get along with their classmates, they might not want to go to school, either. Therefore, these students might be pushed out from others and do not have good friends to do team works, or discuss questions. Going to school becomes a pressure to them.

Making a goal is supposed to good for students, but they always over care too much about their performance. That causes stress to them. To illustrate, some students want to be the top in their classes. In order to achieve this target, they make a tough goal to themselves. They always do not satisfy their performance, even though they do the best at all time. In this kind of self-discipline, some students cannot bear pressure and even commit suicide. 

Pressure in students might not less than wage earners. How can we release those problems? Before having a baby, considering your economy is a good method to avoid a straitened circumstance. Moreover, banks can make a program for student loan. The loan is at the lowest interest for education fee. Secondly, schools let students choose their own classes and grade their teachers. Schools take grades on instructors seriously and do improvements of grading results. The last but not the least, teachers and parents should educate children to have correct values of grades, and teach them to face frustrations.

Our country's culture has still a faction. Even though a faction culture diminishes, that is deep-rooted in Korea. After taking the Korea SAT, someone who is not satisfied suicides. Korea students have a serious pressures. Second, students must continue a good friendships. Students don't like being excluded from friends, but we often annoy a weak friend. We hit and insult him. That is wrong, but If I don't annoy someone, they would annoy me. That situation is very difficult whether I afflict him or not. Students must follow the majority, even though that is wrong behavior. Finally, we must get a job. It is not too much to say that my marriage, money, dream depends on my job. But we are diffcult of getting a good job. Every year, Korea produce many bachelor, but demand is not too enough. Todays, my friends are my enemy. If I must win them, I can get a good job. I think job problem is the biggest pressure of being a student.",2,

On developed countries, be a student can produce you a lot of different feeling and worries because you need to deal with some kind of problems. In the last study published at Medical Student Journal in 2006, they found a few common difficulties that every student feel in order to achieve their goals. The most common problems that they found were: Money problems 45%, leave their families 42% and obtain a big scores 40%. Other but not less important things were: move to other place 22% and anxiety about the new life 18%. Why is so hard to students deal with this kind of problems? 

One of the most important things in this survey was how can you decide to study at one of the best universities in the country if you don't have enough money?. Lot of very intelligent students can't study at Harvard University for example, because the high cost of this university, the cost of books and materials, the student's fraternities and other thinks that they can't pay. That issue produces on the student a lot of stress because their dreams and their projections can be frustrated and probably they prefer don't study and continue their life at other kind of job like mailman, manager building or something like that where their don't need a high level of education. Finally, if they obtain the resources to study in this university their life can be very hard because they need to find a job to try to earn enough money to pay the other things like food, clothes, car, ensures, etc.

The second reason and not least important is about the student's feelings when they need to leave their families. Most of them suffer a lot of sadness and depression to move to other city and loose their parents, their homes and their comfort. It's very difficult to find answers that how you can deal with that, some of them need psychological help to learn how you can adapt to this new life or how you can avoid that these feelings affected your academic performance. Others students prefer to return to their homes and try to changes their careers and return to their past life.

The last important issue is about the pressure that the students feel about the necessity to obtain high scores. Some students adopt the easy way, they prefer cheat on test because they don't want to spend a lot of time studying or because they don't trust enough in their knowledge or in their capacities. For the other side, a lot of students spend days and hours to try to learn more and more because is the only way to obtain great scores and find a great job when they finished their classes, but these means that they loose a big part of their lives because they don't have enough time to share their experiences and their new life.

In conclusion, we need to perform some changes to ovoid these problems like create more funds to help student to solve their economic restrictions, create more universities or improve the other to prevent that student needs to move to other cities and fortify the family structure and modify the way to qualify to permit the student develop more qualities and identify the bad students to the great students. I know this is very difficult to understand and try to change, but if you think in reduce the students stress, fortify family union and found great jobs to great students probably the student's life can be improve.

Nowadays, many young Korean students are substandard in literacy. 
Although Korean elementary and middle school is a duty, many students are not reading books enough and they are not using the Korean language as it is. The outside of them seems not bad but when we look deeper, we can find out that many students have only a surface knowledge. Moreover, they are getting weak in speaking, reading and writing. 
In my opinion, there are some reasons that cause these problems: hard education, the decreasing the number of students who read books and changed language in internet and cell phone text message.

First, students have to do a very hard school schedule in school and academy. All parents wish that their children go to the university. But for this wish many students are forced to go to an academy after school schedules. The school schedule end usually on 4 pm. (Some schools end on 10 pm). After the school they go to an academy for supplementary lessons that end on 10 pm, and the quality of the education is not good. The teachers are only teaching and students are only hearing. It is a one way system without interaction. It is a cramming method of teaching. To follow the quantity of lessons, students are forced to learn. Unfortunately, many students have only a surface knowledge for these reasons. The school is not only hard but only boring for them. They want to have freedom from school and education. 

Second, the number of student who read books in Korea is very low. The reason is that many students use the Internet for searching information instead of the book. We know that the Internet gives us a lot of information. We are living in a world in where we share information on the web. Actually, huge information on the web is convenient to search and it is faster than to go to the library or buying books. We are not charging for them when we use the internet. That's why the Students do not read books for getting information. They are using only the Internet. An instance, in the past I rarely went to the library for my research. It was better for me to use the information on the internet. There was all what I want. The generation of my parents, they used only the book to get information. They read directly, edited and wrote directly. However, we are not doing this work. We copy, past and correct the contents on the internet without books. 

Last, students use the internet language and Text message language that is changed. They want to use a faster and shorter language. The language is in art code that people usually do not understand. They use emoticons and shorter words and changed it so that they are used to it in their live. For example, after checking the diaries of elementary students the teachers were surprised because over 70% of the students used a language like the internet and Text message language. Only 30% wrote in the right way. Many words are getting changed.

For these reasons, many young Korean students are substandard in literacy. More and more of them have only a surface knowledge instead of the deep knowledge. They lose interest in reading books and sitting like a doll in school. They turn their interest to other ways like the internet and learned the language in a wrong way. This problem is not only a problem in Korea but also in other countries. I think all of us have to worry about this important problem.

For many years, illiteracy has been a problem throughout the world, and many countries have tried to fight against this situation mainly because illiteracy delays the economic and social development of society. An illiterate person is unable to read and write due to the deficiency of learning by outside factors or incapacity. Illiteracy is not caused by a lack of intelligence, and it is often a result of external factors or disabilities than can be addressed to help this people. Nowadays, many systems have been developed throughout the world to attack illiteracy, and the most common causes are poverty, low literacy within the family and learning disabilities. They are the main causes of the marginalization of an important part of the worldwide population.

Poverty and illiteracy are related, and they affect individuals and families everywhere because there are many people lack the necessary resources to satisfy the basic social needs or resources to live, such as health, nutrition, education, etc. Therefore, many people cannot start elementary school nor have a simple education because they do not have resources. In addition, many kids have to get a job at the early age to support their families and because they have to help their parents with money, prevent them from going to schools; in consequence, they remain Illiterate. For example, according to M.E. (Ministry of Education), Venezuela 70% of the population is poor; 30% of these people cannot go to school, and this is one of the reasons because they are illiterate. This situation is getting worse due to limitations to development and the learning process, as well as the skills for fighting against illiteracy.

Lack of literacy within the family is another cause of Illiteracy due to no one reading to their children or taking them to the library in some families. Furthermore, there are families where at least one of the parents does not know to read or write, and so they cannot teach to their children. For example, according to O.M.V. (Media Observatory of Venezuela), Venezuela has many parents cannot read because they had to get a job when they were children and never could go to school and learn. Therefore, some of them never introduce literacy to their children or hardly ever saw them reading a book to their children.

Another reason for illiteracy is learning disabilities. Illnesses as Dyslexia, Central Auditory Processing Disorders (C.A.P.D.) and Short Term Memory Difficulties are responsible of many people cannot read. These illnesses are a disruption in the ability of a person; prevent interpreting just simple reading a book. As an Illustration, dyslexia is the incapacity of some people to read and write correctly, disabling them from using or acquire reading and writing.

Illiteracy is a negative aspect of society that it is necessary to eradicate because it is a result of underdevelopment and consequently it limits the progress of society. Poverty, lack of literacy and learning disabilities affect many people throughout of the world and they live in a dark world that brings unemployment, underemployment and social marginalization. Even though the efforts made by the governments have been many to fight this, also it is certain that these efforts have been inefficient and in countries of low resources, it seems that every day there are more illiterate people.

Poverty and illiteracy are related, and they affect individuals and families everywhere because there are many people lack the necessary resources to satisfy the basic social needs or resources to live, such as health, nutrition, education, etc. Therefore, many people cannot start elementary school nor have a simple education because they do not have resources. In addition, many kids have to get a job at the early age to support their families and because they have to help their parents with money, prevent them from going to schools; in consequence, they remain Illiterate. For example, according to M.E. (Ministry of Education), Venezuela 70% of the population is poor; 30% of these people cannot go to school, and this is one of the reasons because they are illiterate. This situation is getting worse due to limitations to development and the learning process, as well as the skills for fighting against illiteracy. Lack of literacy within the family is another cause of Illiteracy due to no one reading to their children or taking them to the library in some families. Furthermore, there are families where at least one of the parents does not know to read or write, and so they cannot teach to their children. For example, according to O.M.V. (Media Observatory of Venezuela), Venezuela has many parents cannot read because they had to get a job when they were children and never could go to school and learn. Therefore, some of them never introduce literacy to their children or hardly ever saw them reading a book to their children. Another reason for illiteracy is learning disabilities. Illnesses as Dyslexia, Central Auditory Processing Disorders (C.A.P.D.) and Short Term Memory Difficulties are responsible of many people cannot read. These illnesses are a disruption in the ability of a person; prevent interpreting just simple reading a book. As an Illustration, dyslexia is the incapacity of some people to read and write correctly, disabling them from using or acquire reading and writing. Illiteracy is a negative aspect of society that it is necessary to eradicate because it is a result of underdevelopment and consequently it limits the progress of society. Poverty, lack of literacy and learning disabilities affect many people throughout of the world and they live in a dark world that brings unemployment, underemployment and social marginalization. Even though the efforts made by the governments have been many to fight this, also it is certain that these efforts have been inefficient and in countries of low resources, it seems that every day there are more illiterate people.","For many years, illiteracy has been a problem throughout the world, and many countries have tried to fight against this situation mainly because illiteracy delays the economic and social development of society.

Many countries including Taiwan encourage their citizens to study English to connect with other countries. After studying English for several years, the benefits of learning English to me are to communicate with people can't speak Chinese, to be competitive in studying and getting a good job, and to help me realize the Western culture and get alone with the Western people.
First, I can use English to communicate with foreigners. When I travel other countries, I can use English to ask people questions and information. Last time I went to Australia with my friends and I lost my wallet in an aquarium. I was anxious and all my friends helped me to look around. Then I asked someone where the customer information was and asked for help there. After I described the shape and color of my wallet, they took out mine that someone found that and sent to there. That is the first time I discover English is a so important language. I have to learn to talk with people in other countries. 
The second, learning English can help me be competitive in studying and getting a job. In Taiwan, English is one subject of the National Exam for entering college. Besides, the books for most majors in college are written in English. I need using English to read journal, write essay and then can finish my studying. Furthermore, I need to take to English exams, such as TOEFL, GRE, or TOEIC for higher studying or getting a job in the top companies. The good ability of English can help me achieve my goal. 
Finally, I can get along with the Western people through learning English. The culture between the East and the West is really different. However, the contact and exchange time is increasing. Many words have different meanings between Chinese and English. I have to learn and avoid misunderstanding or being impolite. For example, I should use ""African American"" in place of ""Black people"" because the second is really impolite and even a war started cause that. Now, I live in the United States and study there. I must understand the Western culture by learning English. That will help me to get along with people there. 
English is the world language, and we can use it to communicate with others to get information. It's also important for getting a higher degree or a good job. Moreover, in order to live in the United States, I should understand their culture and background. The three above are my benefits from studying English.

Moreover, your life and diet habit is a crucial factor of causing heart disease as well. Having too much working pressure causes high blood pressure. High pressure will damage arteries and may cause heart disease. In addition, obesity and sedentary lifestyle burden the heart with hard work. The more tasks the heart has, the higher risk for developing heart disease you have. And lest but not least, smokers are two or three times more likely to have a heart attack than nonsmokers.

Finally, some diseases may bring out heart disease. To illustrate, diabetes can lead to hardening of the arteries and heart attacks. High cholesterol levels are dangerous because fatty deposits build up in blood vessels.

However, it seems that it is very easy to have heart disease. Actually, we can avoid causing heart disease. We should have regular exercise life, for example, by either joining a fitness club or playing some sports with friends. Hence, we can keep a normal weight, and blood vessels will not be built up. Furthermore, we need to release our stress. Traveling and exercising are helpful methods for relaxing. Although we cannot avoid hereditary heart disease, we can be aware our family illness history.

Smokers are two or three times more likely to have a heart attack than nonsmoker. Smoking is an active behavior like cutting the grass and climbing mountains. It means that smoking is not inevitable. Although a lot of cardiologists consent the smoking as a major cause, if someone did smoking that would be a kind of a cruelty to oneself.
Next, the cardiologist pointed out a sedentary lifestyle as a minor cause. As the information society has developed, the lifestyle is changed suddenly. Instead of living by labor, people are working with taking a seat all day long. The development of transportation and technology also contribute to the scarcity of exercise. Watching TV on the sofa and moving by a car have substituted taking a walk and practical exercise in the house. We should stand up and drive ourselves to move our body, because that is a correctable cause of heart disease by our will.
Finally, the controllable and correctable cause is obesity. Though it is just a minor cause, it is harmful to our health in many aspects like the other causes do it in same ways. The reasons of obesity are similar to the one of sedentary lifestyle, but the eating habit is more crucial to the obesity. To correct the obesity, you should rearrange your menu as well as do physical exercise. No one say that is easy, but it is worth it.
Heart disease was not a serious problem until 1970's. However, as the lifestyle has been changing, the rate has been increasing.

Heart disease became serious disease today. Heart is the most important organ for people, so we need to concentrate heart disease, and to consider disease's causes. I will introduce main causes from now, and that causes can distinguish major ans minor causes. 
 The first risk factor is major causes of heart disease. It is fractionized several factors. First, it affect family history. In other words, you are at a higher risk for developing heart disease if your parents or grandparents have had it. It can't solve by myself, because family history is inborn. Second, because of high blood pressure, we can fall heart disease. According to recent estimates, nearly one in three U.S. adults has high blood pressure, Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to stroke, heart attack, heart failure or kidney failure. Third, high cholesterol is dangerous because fatty deposits build up in blood vessels, and diabetes can lead to hardening of the arteries and heart attacks. finally, smoking cigarettes is dangerous. Cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of premature death in the United States. It accounts for nearly 440,000 deaths each year, of which more than 135,000 are due to smoking related cardiovascular diseases, smokers are two or three times more likely to have a heart attack than nonsmokers.
The another risk factor is minor causes of heart disease. It has three causes. First of all, Having a Type A personality such as becoming easily stressed, being overly competitive, aggressive, and intense causes heart disease. Second, Having a sedentary lifestyle can causes it, because it can't get enough exercise. Finally, Obesity is really not good. Obesity always follow high blood pressure and high cholesterol level. In other word, being extremely overweight and having a poor diet are not good for you.
I explained causes of heart disease until now. And it can divide two causes largely, then it can classify several reasons. Someone usually say, ""prevention is better than cure."" 
If you are careful of these risk factors, you can detect heart disease in advance, and you can keep healthily and happily your life.

This disease has a number of abnormal conditions affecting the heart and the blood vessels in the heart. Types of heart disease include: Coronary artery disease, heart failure and heart arrhythmias. The three most important causes or risk factors for HD are family history, high blood pressure and tobacco. Exist other causes like diabetes, high cholesterol levels, personality type A, sedentary life and obesity.

The most important issue related with heart disease is the family history. If a family member (father, mother, brother, sister) has a history of early heart disease (before age 55 for men and before age 65 for women), you are at a higher risk for heart disease than someone with no family history of early heart disease That means if one of the first-degree relatives have HD, your possibilities to develop the disease are higher. The family members share common habits, lifestyles, environments and inherited traits. Therefore, you need to increase the control to the other risks like high blood pressure, smoking cigarettes, diabetes and high cholesterol levels because the family history is the only that you can't modified.

The second but not least important risk is high blood pressure or hypertension (HTN). The normal blood pressure is when your systolic blood pressure is lower than 120 mmHg and your diastolic blood pressure is lower than 80mmHg (BP 120/80 mmHg), if you have values higher than BP 140/90 mmHg you are hypertensive. The American Heart Association recommends controlling your blood pressure twice a year if you have less than fifty year old and don't have risk factors. If you have more than fifty years, have family history of high blood pressure or any other risks like obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol level, personality type A or having a sedentary life you need to measure your blood pressure once a month and check with your doctor twice a years. The HTN produce number of troubles in your heart, for instance: wall thicknesses, obstruction of coronary vessels and heart failure. 

The third risk is smoking cigarette. It ""the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States"" and cause more than 450.000 deaths per year in the United States. The American Heart Association found a high correlation about tobacco and HD. If you don't smoke and don't have risk factors the option that you have the disease is lower than people who smoke. Otherwise, if you smoke, the nicotine benefits fat deposit in the blood vessels and reduces its lumen and increases the heart work leading to heart failure. 

In conclusion the only way to try to decrease the incidence of this disease is to control the risk factors. I mean stop to smoking, control hypertension eat a low fat calories, do exercise 30 minutes per day and manage your blood lipid levels and cholesterol. The different problem is family history because this factor is impossible to change but. This probably is the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality of HD.","Every day three million people died for HD. In the US, HD is a first cause of dead among people older than 50 years old.

The effects of divorce not only will influence their children, but also will effect parents themselves, such as single mother and single father are increasing, the behavior and thoughts of parents and children will change and the social phenomenon will be different.

Due to the rising divorce rate, both single mother and single father have increase.

Because of many families who got divorce have children, when they separated, children will go with a parent. And most of the mothers seldom will let the fathers to see their children, because of some reasons that fathers used to have the wrong behavior. ""Fathers have only infrequent contact with their children or lose touch with them altogether."" The author goes on to say, ""Some have proclaimed the 'death of the dad'."" 

After one family separated into two, their behavior and thoughts also will change. Once one of the parents said I want to divorce, the thought of the marriage is wonderful had gone. Both parents might think they are not good at marriage, and they would not get married anymore. For their children, they might act like their parent.

Almost every single parent needs to work all day long, and they might not have enough time to educate their children by themselves. The single parent probably will take their children to their parents to take care of them. But usually it would not improved that it is a better way for children to take care by grandparents instead of their parent.

The effects of divorce on family life truly has lots of problems. From personal to sociocultural level, it influences amount of layers.

Y,C638,10858,ac3,Chinese,Female,228,4,w,1464,2,474,440,440,"Regardless of age, race, sex or religion, when a couple goes into marriage, both of them think over whether they are the right person for the other. However, after getting married, some might feel they do not love their spouse enough; they have trouble communicating with each other; they do not like relatives of their spouse, and they get tired of being a couple, they want to divorce. Divorcing does not just affect husband and wife, it also strikes against their relatives, even their children.

First of all, husband and wife are the first people who are shocked by divorce. For example, arguing, conflict and lack of communication let them feel tired with marriage. Even though they are usually able to articulate their emotions and verbalize their discontent to each other, they still cannot cope with the problem between themselves. Therefore, divorce is one way in which they might be concerned.

In addition, husband and wife are not only concerned about their feelings, but they also may have misgivings about their relatives. Their father-in-law or mother-in-law, for example, might feel embarrassed about this divorce. If father-in-law or mother-in-law likes their daughter-in-law or son-in-law, they will want to persuade them to stay. Spouses do not want to be an unfilial son or daughter, but they cannot solve the problem between them. In this situation, the elders' emotion gives spouses pressure. They might agonize over the divorce.

Children, on the other hand, are unlikely to have the ability to face parents' divorce; children are the ones most serious affected by divorce. What causes stress for children? Ph. D. ANON_NAME_0 DeBord, Child Development Specialist, said, ""The family they have always known will be different."" For instance, many things will change, not just mother or dad. Children may need to adjust to a new schedule, bedtime, mealtime routines. This causes upheaval to children. Moreover, according to DeBord, ""Fear of abandonment"" children are afraid that if they lose one parent, they may lose the other. Third, ""Children worry about hostility between parents,"" DeBord noted. Children may feel stress in many of parents' words and actions.

In retrospect, although divorce brings some effects to family, divorce is a final way to deal with an unsolvable problem between spouses. Adults have abilities to seek other's assistance, or they can verbalize their feelings in order to release their pressure. However, children do not have abilities like adults; parents need to pay more attention to their children to help them to face parents' divorce, such as playing with them and talking with them. Those vehicles can reduce their feelings of vulnerability, so that children can have saneness during growing.","Regardless of age, race, sex or religion, when a couple goes into marriage, both of them think over whether they are the right person for the other.

After get married, more pass time, more and more couples are getting divorce and negative effects spread with the divorce. Recently, the number increases more then before few years. I often see a report of divorce on the news. I feel sorry when I hear about it. The people's divorce has had three important effects and causes. 

First of all, they have to consider with children before think about divorce. Divorce has negative effects on children. When they divorce, their children feel dissatisfaction, infelicity and depressed. Because, changes their life have negative effect on changes in living patterns. Children have qualification for their parent's protected and love while they're growing up. That's too important for children with their personality and emotion. They have to be responsible their children so, they have to take care of their children's health and try to give them and education is necessary for a good life. 

Second of all, one of cause is changing woman's roles, stress in modern living and lack of communication, which are highlighted below. The first significant cause of recent divorce is that women completely change in roles. In the past, men have to earn whole money to afford the expense of family, whereas woman only do housework, hence women have no money leading to depend on husbands' money. Because of these situations, it is too difficult for most women to separate from their husbands. Another cause to confirm the recent increase in divorce rates is stress in modern living. Many people, who live in the world, they have considerable pressures to earn money. 

Finally, I think the other cause is that they have a wide gap of personality between couples. They don't know the each others dissimilarity in character still they are married. And they feel that disparity in personality when several years pass away. Then they are thinking that living with her or him is a very hard thing. And they get divorced. The Result, they hurt their mind with pain. And they have much stress to meet people again. ""Impulsive, frivolous divorce"" is suffered more damage into family. So, they have to make decision circumspectly. 

Some person advised to someone who is thinking about divorce. ""You need to be able to look at your life as whole and decide if it is good or bad. You also need to look at every possible aspect of your relationship with your spouse and see if the good outweighs the bad, or if the bad outweighs the good. Sometimes your judgement is clouded when you only focus on the good or only on the bad. The bottom line is to do what you need to do to have a more fulfilling and happy life.""

Many people, who live in the world, they have considerable pressures to earn money. Finally, I think the other cause is that they have a wide gap of personality between couples. They don't know the each others dissimilarity in character still they are married. And they feel that disparity in personality when several years pass away. Then they are thinking that living with her or him is a very hard thing. And they get divorced. The Result, they hurt their mind with pain. And they have much stress to meet people again. ""Impulsive, frivolous divorce"" is suffered more damage into family. So, they have to make decision circumspectly. Some person advised to someone who is thinking about divorce. ""You need to be able to look at your life as whole and decide if it is good or bad. You also need to look at every possible aspect of your relationship with your spouse and see if the good outweighs the bad, or if the bad outweighs the good. Sometimes your judgement is clouded when you only focus on the good or only on the bad. The bottom line is to do what you need to do to have a more fulfilling and happy life."" ","Most couple is married when they love each other and they are sure their mate to get married. After get married, more pass time, more and more couples are getting divorce and negative effects spread with the divorce. Recently, the number increases more then before few years. I often see a report of divorce on the news. I feel sorry when I hear about it. The people's divorce has had three important effects and causes. First of all, they have to consider with children before think about divorce. Divorce has negative effects on children. When they divorce, their children feel dissatisfaction, infelicity and depressed. Because, changes their life have negative effect on changes in living patterns. Children have qualification for their parent's protected and love while they're growing up. That's too important for children with their personality and emotion. They have to be responsible their children so, they have to take care of their children's health and try to give them and education is necessary for a good life. Second of all, one of cause is changing woman's roles, stress in modern living and lack of communication, which are highlighted below. The first significant cause of recent divorce is that women completely change in roles. In the past, men have to earn whole money to afford the expense of family, whereas woman only do housework, hence women have no money leading to depend on husbands' money. Because of these situations, it is too difficult for most women to separate from their husbands. Another cause to confirm the recent increase in divorce rates is stress in modern living.

 most stressful life events a person can experience. Coleman and Morgan (2002) stated,

 ""The decision to divorce is typically made with ambivalence, uncertainly and 

confusion"". The effects of divorce can be hazardous to the group who experiences this

 crisis; for example, they probably have legal problems, emotional problems or economic

 problems.


First, at all the legal divorce is one of the most important items that the divorced people 

need to resolve. That means the legal purpose of divorce is to allow individuals to marry 

again, to start a new life, to cut the umbilical cord with your ex wife or husband. If they 

don't have children almost certainly this part of the divorce can be less difficult than with 

children, because when you have children you need to set up a parenting plan, including 

joint custody or sole custody, the amount of each parents give to maintain their children, 

etc. Joint custody means that the parents share the decisions about their children and sole 
custody means the children live most of the time with one parents and he or she make the 

decisions about the children. Then they need to decide what they do with everything that 

they have; for example, furniture, properties, kitchen items and devices will need to be 

divided. Finally they need to cancel bank accounts, credit cards and bills that they share.


Second, the emotional problem can be the most hazardous and stressful life event. ""The 

may experience feeling of denial, anger, then go through bargaining, depression, and 

finally acceptance"" (Coleman and Morgan 2002). But this process doesn't only produce 

those feelings; occasionally they can feel guilty, lonely, unhappy and commit suicide. 

This part of divorce is very difficult to manage because most of them probably require 

professional help like psychological help and accept this, for otherwise some of then have 

the capacity to resolve alone their problems and can continue their lives. When some of 

them don't want help and don't have the capacity to resolve their troubles, this affects 

their jobs, their study, increase risk of alcohol abuse and frequently lose social contact 

with family and friends. 



The third problem can be the economic divorce. This trouble can be divided in two; one 

of them is when they need to maintain two houses, which imply more work, more stress, 

and more effort to find money to resolve that. And second, if they don't need to maintain 

another house probably they need to buy or rent another place to live, acquire furniture, 

kitchen items, and devices and again they need more money. Some people prefer to 

return to their family homes to avoid this economic problem while they save money to 

start a new single life.


In conclusion, divorce changes the life in different ways like emotional or economic and 

if they don't know how to manage these kinds of changes probably they will have a lot of 

troubles in their life.

We can go everywhere in the world if we want to. That means we are in a global village. However, when we go abroad, we are given culture shock. 
Culture shock is a feeling of anxiety, loneliness, and confusion that people sometimes experience when they first arrive in another country. In case of me, even if I've been here for 5months, I feel culure shock until now.
There are several causes of culture shock which I experienced : language, food, climate.

The first is language. Even if I have learned foreign language, there is big problem to communicate with native speaker. For a couple months I couldn't do anything, because english is not my first language. I felt embarrassed whatever I did. I wanted to get a driver licsence before I got a car, but due to I didn't understant most saying which the officer told me, I couldn't help visiting there several times with angry. When I went to restaurant, if I was bad at pronunciation I couldn't even order food. In addition, One day my host mother gave me some important informations to go shop and buy. At that moment I thought I understand everything which she said, but I didn't. I remember that I spent hard time on the street. Everything what I said are from culture shock of language.


The next is food. In my case, even if I like american food a lot, I'm missing my country's food. One of my friends was in big trouble because of food. American food is too greasy to eat for him. In fact, most korean can't stand that don't eat rice and Kim-chi. As I said, I'm crazy at american food, but when I eat only hamburger for 2days I got a stomache. I have some friends who are sick of american food, though it's not easy cook korean food in USA,
 they cook and eat korean food everyday. Culture shock of food makes them hard.


The last is climate. Every country has own climae. While some countries are too hot, others are too cold. Though we have too cold winter, 
I was shocked by weather at the first time of pittsburgh. I was shocked because I'v never canceled class because of snow before I came here. In first month I came pittsburgh, I got a cold everyday. The differences of weather brought me down and made me difficult. In addition summer of pittsburgh makes me 
exhausted. The summer of pittsburgh is too hot and humid, so it's hard to even breathe. The difference of weather is kind of culture shock too.


I think there are more causes of culture shock examples than I wrote. Even if these make me difficult, I decided to enjoy the differences and overcome troubles. In case of language, I began to ask native speaker to say slow. Of course I do my best to study englsih. And I'm finding many american food which is fit me because it's hard to eat korean food everyday for me. Finally, I'm going to buy air conditional in summer, and heater in winter.

Even if these make me difficult, I decided to enjoy the differences and overcome troubles. In case of language, I began to ask native speaker to say slow. Of course I do my best to study englsih. And I'm finding many american food which is fit me because it's hard to eat korean food everyday for me. Finally, I'm going to buy air conditional in summer, and heater in winter. That's one of my way to overcome culture shock and difference between korea and USA. ",2,3lang ok

Culture Shock is not a clinical term or medical disruption. It is simply a way to describe the nervousness and confusion feel that a person can undergo when leaving a culture that is familiar to him or her to live in a completely different culture. Consequently, when one moving to a new place, you must face many changes. For many people, these changes can be overwhelming and negative, but in my opinion, these changes can also be exciting and stimulating. In addition, culture shock is a great opportunity to learn and acquire new perspectives, and it has had several positive effects on me during my stay in ELI; for example: I have developed a better understanding of myself, learned customs of other countries and stimulated my personal creativity.
Developing a better understanding of myself has been a very positive effect for my personality. I do not feel forced to change who everything what I am, because of the fact that I am in a new culture. Instead of forgetting my culture, I have been able to assimilate a new one. I have been open mind it to know the new things and to do them. I have identified the things that are equal and those that are different; and remembered that the variety is what makes people interesting. The fact that I am experiencing a new culture does not mean that I am the only one that must learn something. Now, I want to show to other people my own culture. It is possible that they do not know much about my culture. This also will help them to know more about me. For example, I have invited them to my house to enjoy typical dishes of my country, and they told me that these dishes were very good and they were surprised about the way that I made them. Some of them wanted some recipes about some foods, and they cheer me up, and now I am more confident about my culture and myself. I have kept in mind that all my experiences life is part of my personality and for this reason I am a special person.
Another effect was to learn customs of other countries. It helped me to face the anxiety that arises from the transfer to a new place. However, I have learned things about the other countries, and it has been easier for me to feel comfortable. I have researched about what people do for fun, observed how people interact with others and what they consider important. Also, I have obtained more information watching television and movies. These mass media has helped me to learn the formal language and the colloquial one; and I have been even allow starting a conversation and making new friends. The subjects of conversation, the way in which they are expressed and the importance that they give to certain ideas can differ enough of what I am accustomed to. For example, in my culture when we say good bye we kiss each other on the cheek, and in USA people do not do that. However, I do not have to like everything what I have discovered of the new culture, but when I have known what people mean when they are using certain phrases or why they dress a in a particular way, I have begun to feel much better.
Many people that emigrate from other countries have the ability to positively confront the obstacles of a new environment and they have stimulated their personal creativity like I did. For example, I have developed a hobby for scrapbook. Soon afterward, I have been thinking to establish a new company in my country that it specializes in articles to do scrapbook, and it is as a result of that I learned more about scrapbook. Furthermore, I have learned to be constructive and be gentle to myself. When I began to adapt to the new culture; immediately, I began to develop abilities that I was not known before and could establish new objectives in my own life 

The key to overcome culture shock is to understand the new culture and to find the way to live comfortably in it while I stay loyal to the values of my own culture. Is important that I be myself; I am not forced to change too fast or to change too many things at the same time. Everybody must face changes in their lives and perhaps it seems to me that I must go through more changes than the average person. I remembered that I will not have problems as long as you manage to maintain what is important to me and, I am able to obtain a good combination of the new and the old. The most important things that I have done are: relax, rest, keep an open mind, and have fun!!!!

Y,C623,10679,fz5,Chinese,Female,227,4,w,1517,1,570,565,565,"People who want to live or study in another country must understand the effects of culture shock. I came from Taiwan, and arrived at United States two months ago. The two counties have quiet different cultures, customs, and habits. In the beginning, I really felt something which were stranger and made me uncomfortable then I had some culture shocks. In my opinion, the three main effects of culture shock are: being homesick, avoiding contact with others, and refusing to accept new changes.
 There are many different between Taiwan and the United States, such as language, people, life style, climate, etc. For example, so many ethic groups in the United States, and I didn't know how to get along with people who have different eye and hair color. In addition, after I started to cook for the meal, I found that it was difficult to buy the similar food, vegetable or sauce in supermarket there. I had many problems and question wanted to ask but I couldn't express and comprehend well. That was frustrated me. For those reasons, I felt homesick and really missed my familiar life and food in Taiwan. Fortunately, I knew some students also came from Taiwan and have lived in Pittsburgh more than one year. They went outside with me, gave me some instructions, and shared with their experience. Those were good way to help me adapt this new environment. 
 The second, affect of the culture shock is decreasing contact with other people, especially is caused by the language problem. Many people like me don't have enough ability to speak and comprehend English well. However, I have to greet and talk with people everywhere without exception. I was afraid to receive the phone calls with English. It was a pity that I almost could not understand what people said at all one month ago. At that time, what I only wanted to do is to stay at home alone after class. However, I always told myself not to avoid going outside and I need to overcome the problem. I forced myself to go shopping at least twice a week and participate into some activities, such as TGIF, culture exchange meeting, and talk time. I made myself to be used to get alone with people and practiced English anytime. 
 The last effect is refusing the new change. Take myself for example; there are a lot of new food and vegetables and I didn't know how to eat or cook them at first. I just hoped to find the similar food of Taiwan; there is no place to put and I don't want to use clothes dryer anymore. I tried to cook and dry the clothes by my own way, but those made me feel different with others. However, after several weeks later, I gradually tried to open my mind to accept the new change. Those were not as bad as I imaged, and some were even better than what I did before.
 Having culture shock is easy to people who want to live in a different country. It is easy to feel lonely, hope to go back the hometown, and deal with things as the same way before. Overcoming the culture shocks need time and confidence. Opening the mind and trying to understand the different culture may be helpful to solve the effects of culture shock. I did that and that really worked.

 What are the qualities of friends? Since coming to Pittsburgh, I have also thought about this question.

However, we know each other, and I know we are always friends even after we haven't seen each other for a long time. Though I left many friends in Korea, and I know that we can not see one another for a while, we don't worry about our relationship, which has connected us for a long time. Because we believe that our feelings will never change.
 Nevertheless, how about the time which friends spend together? Is it the crucial factor for friends? I don't think so. It is true that spending time together is helpful for a friendship, but it is not always necessary. I have a lot of people whom I met as acquaintances at first in Pittsburgh, and some of them have become my friends relatively quickly, because we accepted each other's thoughts and behavior which are similar. I hope that I can meet more friends whom I have not met yet and have a solid friendships.

Though I left many friends in Korea, and I know that we can not see one another for a while, we don't worry about our relationship, which has connected us for a long time. Because we believe that our feelings will never change. Nevertheless, how about the time which friends spend together? Is it the crucial factor for friends? I don't think so. It is true that spending time together is helpful for a friendship, but it is not always necessary. I have a lot of people whom I met as acquaintances at first in Pittsburgh, and some of them have become my friends relatively quickly, because we accepted each other's thoughts and behavior which are similar. I hope that I can meet more friends whom I have not met yet and have a solid friendships.",2,

I think a best friend is someone who always tells me the truth because he doesn't need to cheat me. He always wants my happiness and my felicity. He always has better perspective than me about my problems, and know how he can help me to find a solution. He understands me, respects me and accepts me the way I am. This friend who helps me when I am in trouble is someone who doesn't have a price because there isn't enough money to pay him for everything that he does for me like listen me, give an advice, support me and be my friend.

A friend is someone who keeps my secret, who is my partner, who does things with me and who shares his feelings with me. Probably a best friend and a friend share similar characteristics, but a best friend is someone who is always on my side, is my right arm and has heart while a friend is someone who is not always there.

When I was sixteen years old, she started to live at school, because she became a college student. She only comes home on weekends, sometimes she even does not come back. There are some similarities between my sister and me; there also are some differences between us, like personality, interest and habit.

My sister's and my personality are entirely different. I am a little bit neat with the place I stay. I like to put everything back to their places once I cleaned them up. And it is more convenience to find what I want if they are at their places. On the other hand, my sister does not do well at keeping her clothes, books and any other personal materials organized. She will put them at a place she sees first when she came home. So she always needs me to help her find them. Although she cannot organize her clothes, books and personal materials, she is a good leader. She is good at managing when she and her classmates are doing groups work. She can tell them which step is the most important that needs to do first, and which should do next. She will be the person who leads in front of people, and that is different from me. I do not like to lead in front of people, because I am a low-keyed person. I can tell people which should do first and which should do next, but it is private. Also, she can make decision once she has problems by choosing which clothes she would buy, which shoes are fit her than others or what she wants to eat when it is lunch or dinner time. I need to spend a lot of time making a decision; therefore, I am learning how to make decision quickly and correctly.

For interest, she likes to eat breads and cakes, and so do I. She often brings cheese and garlic flavor breads home after she came back from school, and she always buy two bags of them. Sometimes she brings cheese and original flavor buns instead. Both breads and buns are delicious that I want to eat every day in my life. Both my sister and me like outdoor activities, but we do not like to be tanned. Most people in Taiwan do not like that, because it is not good for our skin. Therefore, we often choose evening time to have activities with our friends. She likes cute little dolls as much as I do. When she sees them on a street during the shopping, she will buy them if she can. Although I like cute little dolls, I also like unique products, for example, punk products. Every time I hang out with my friends, I went to punk shops that I familiar with to find something new. But my sister does not like that; she said it is different from her style. And she is good at design new pictures, whereas I am not. I need to be inspired by some examples, but my sister, she does not need that. She can draw a picture without thinking too much, though my draw is better than her.

There are several different habits between my sister and me. She likes to eat a lot and quickly, but she also wants to diet. I always need to tell her not to eat too fast or she will eat more than she used to eat. And I also need to remind her not to eat too much when she is at home during meals time, because there are too many tasty foods. However, I like to eat as slow as I can, not only good for health, but also good for diet. I can control how much I eat and will not eat too much. Also, I can control myself not to have too many desserts or snacks during meals. For clothe style, she likes neutral style; on the other hand, I prefer more lady style. When we went to shopping, she liked to see clothes with cute pictures on them. Although I like cute pictures, sometimes I think they are too childish. But she helps me a lot on how to wear clothes that can let people feel I am much more adultness.

Although we have many differences on habit and personality, we have more similarities on interest, and that helps us to get along for long times. We both like cute little dolls.

Y,K1191,11447,gv1,Korean,Male,228,4,w,1641,2,381,366,366,"Before I came here, I had lived in Seoul, Korea. Actually, I was born in Seoul, and I grew up in Seoul. So, I knew Seoul's information such as transportation, buildings, and weather. I have been here for 10 month. I don't know about Pittsburgh exactly, but I may know about it a little. I think the differences between Seoul and Pittsburgh are very different.

First, Seoul's transportation is very complicated and developed. Seoul's subway line has 10 lines. If someone doesn't use the map, he/she can't search a destination; also, bus lines are very useful, because we make bus road for exclusive use. Seoul always has a heavy traffic, but if we ride a bus, we won't feel stuffy by heavy traffic. Pittsburgh's transportation is not complicated. Almost people don't use the subway, and here rarely has a heavy traffic. Pittsburgh has bus lines for exclusive use, too. And I can't see many taxies in Pittsburgh, but I can see them in Seoul as much as in New York.

Second, Seoul's buildings are very high, because our country is small. We have a lot of apartments over 15th floor. Actually, if we go anywhere in Seoul, most of buildings are high. Most of Pittsburgh's buildings are high as in downtown, others are not. Here doesn't have high apartments, because people usually live in private house. So, I can see the sky clearly in here, but Seoul which is blocked by high buildings is different.

Third, Seoul's weather is different from Pittsburgh. Seoul has a localized torrential downpour for month in July. We must be careful with the flood and many crops are damaged. Also, Seoul is wet in summer, so the sweat comes out easily. People's discomfort index is very higher in summer, so rate of crime rises up. Pittsburgh is usually dry, so clothes are dried easily. Pittsburgh often rains, but is sunny at once. I think Pittsburgh has a very changeable weather, so people's emotion is changed easily.

In conclusion, Seoul and Pittsburgh have many differences. And each of them has advantage and disadvantage. Even though their atmosphere, such as buildings, transportation, weather, both of them are beautiful cities for people to live.

I have a sister whose name is Jin-Young, and she is different from me. And she is 2 years older than me. Many people said that we look similar, so they sometimes can't distinguish us on the pictures. But we are different from jobs, personalities and interesting.

The first thing is that we have different job, before I came to Pittsburgh. My sister has been working as a dental hygienist. She likes her job because she likes to meet people and she take care people's teeth, whereas I have been working at trading company. I've never liked my job because I preferred to actively work such as flight attendance or designer. But I've been working at office. It's uncomfortable for me.

Second, we are totally different character. She is a sincere lady. Her sincerity shows off her character. I think she is now much outgoing than she used to be. That's why she spends almost time with many people to talk or she has to give advice to people about their teeth. On the other hand, I was a kind of introvert person, but I changed my personality when I entered my company.

","I have a sister whose name is Jin-Young, and she is different from me. And she is 2 years older than me. Many people said that we look similar, so they sometimes can't distinguish us on the pictures. But we are different from jobs, personalities and interesting. The first thing is that we have different job, before I came to Pittsburgh. My sister has been working as a dental hygienist. She likes her job because she likes to meet people and she take care people's teeth, whereas I have been working at trading company. I've never liked my job because I preferred to actively work such as flight attendance or designer. But I've been working at office. It's uncomfortable for me. Second, we are totally different character. She is a sincere lady. Her sincerity shows off her character. I think she is now much outgoing than she used to be. That's why she spends almost time with many people to talk or she has to give advice to people about their teeth. On the other hand, I was a kind of introvert person, but I changed my personality when I entered my company.

My brother and I have an extraordinary relationship. We are brothers and friends. We have lived together almost 30 years and we share our success and our failures. To avoid misunderstandings, I talked with my father and asked him to help me to compare myself with my brother. We have our similarities like our eyes, our careers, our feelings and emotions, and our differences, for example: physical differences, the way that we can perceive the life and how to express our emotions. It was only after looking in my mind and talked with my father that I can find the differences and similarities between him and me and then write this essay about us.

At first, it seems that my brother and I haven't a lot in common, but we share some similarities. For example, physically we have the same eye color, the same eyebrows, and if you take a picture only of this part of our body, you can not find any difference between us. My father is a doctor, my brother is a doctor and I am a doctor too. We have the same way to make friends. We have a special charisma that other people like, and this is why we have a lot of friends. How I express my feelings and emotions is the same as my brother; we enjoy the music, we are very happy when we can join together, we share with my father the most spectacular moments in our life and I think in this instant of my life we are the closets that we have ever been.

At the same time, we have a lot of differences probably more than similarities but this is why we are partners. Despite the fact that we have the same eyes, other characteristics are very different; for example: I am taller than him, he is thinner than me and he is older than me. On the other side, he is more intelligent and smarter than me. When we were young, we studied at the same high school and always his scores were higher than mine. In contrast, my scores at the university were better than his scores, but that does not mean anything about the intelligence because when we finished our medical school he decided to follow ophthalmology, have a better life, more money, free weekends and he doesn't have night shifts. On the other hand, I choose surgery, which I think gives a worse life, less money, a lot of night shifts and only one free weekend at month. This is why he is and will be more intelligent than me. Another difference between both of us is how we perceive the life. To my brother, life is great. He wakes up every morning happy, without stress and he looks for the best way to enjoy everyday. Although I always smile, that doesn't mean I am okay; everyday I need to find a motive to worry me and I always think about the negative side of life. He is very calm, tranquil, serene, peaceful and diplomatic; but I am the opposite: I am stressful, demanding, tense, worrying and anxious. Finally, he stopped studying and started to enjoy his life, while I continue studying and waiting to see when I can start to enjoy my life.

In conclusion, when you read this essay immediately you think how these two brothers can have an extraordinary relationship if they are so different? This is the point; our relationship is excellent because we are poles apart, each one is the complement to the other. We belong to the different side of the coin, we can discuss each topic without any difficulty and we help each other to find a solution to our troubles.

In this moment, is very difficult to know what is the most important influence on young adults, because now the young adults spend more time with their friends than their parents. The parents need more money because every day the prices increase, sometimes they don't want to spend time with their children or they prefer solve their problems before that they thought in their children. Why that is happen?

First, because parents need to earn more money to pay bills, pay young adults education, pay the house and the food. That means they need to spend more time in their jobs and spend less time with their sons. Then the young adults share the most part of their life with their friend. Sometimes, they learn about the life with their experiences or their friends experiences and don't have guide to solve their problems, because their parents don't have enough time to explain and teach about the best way to solve this problems like tobacco use, alcohol or sexual behavior.

Second, most of the parents don't want to spend more time with their children. In this country I don't understand why the parents always think about when their children grow up and go to high school as far as they can. They have children only to continue the race. In my country we spend the most part of our life with our parents. That means we learn a lot of items because our parents teach us. The most of young adults in my country try to study near to their parents house that they can to spend more time with their parents.

Third, the couples have a lot of troubles and they think first how to solve their problems, how to avoid the divorce or sometimes they prefer divorce to avoid more fights. In this process they don't take care their children and young adults. The children and young adults spend this time with their friends.

Therefore, 14 consonants and 10 vowels were introduced. This monumental achievement could spread out to general low level people who were assumed to be abandoned from literacy.

 Nowadays, the scientific Korean alphabets, which have only 14 consonants and 10 vowels, can be used in many ways. Simple formation and constitution can be applied easily on the keyboard.

Worse yet, this region is ""famous"" for its ""outstanding"" criminal rate. Immediately, I felt unfriendly noticing around. I had no choice; I put on my special sunglasses and erased the street robbers' memories. All right, it seemed that jogging was the fastest solution to my office.

When I arrived at work, I found a note on my desk form my boss. She wanted to see me right away. I took a deep breath and walked into her office. As I stepped inside, I noticed a scowl on her face.

""That is not an excuse! You had just erased more than 200 people's memories"" she yelled angrily. I thought I should remain my silence to avoid annoying her anymore. That strategy worked.

Unfortunatelly, there are traffic jams in the old part of town. What happened? My god, maybe other peoples met the same problem of being late, so that many cars were crowded on the road. Time past quickly, when could I got to work, I worried. When I arrived at work, I found a note on my desk from my boss. She wanted to see me right away. I took a deep breath and walked into her office. As I stepped inside, I noticed a scowl on her face. “why are you so late today?"" my boss shouted at me. ""Don't you remmember what date is it today?"" ""Oh, I am so sorry for being late because?? She couldnot help listening to me."" It's the last day to hand in your technical report. There are many data should be updated. Our expert David wanted to talk with you on these data this morning, but you were late. So you had to finish it yourself. Remmember all should done before 4 clock."" Back to my desk, I didn't eat lunch to catch up with time and finally I finished at 3:59 and handed in.",1,

As I rushed down the stairs to eat a quick breakfast, I tripped over my cat and tumbled down to the ground. I felt my left leg was very painful. When I took a look at my leg, it was bleeding. But when I returned to my door for bandages, I searched every pocket and my back-pack for the door key and I didn't find it. So I turned to my neighbors to get help, but no one answered me when I knocked their doors. I had no choice but ran to a CVS/pharmacy store. What surprised me was the notice on the front door of this store, which told me that this tore had been moved out of this area. I could not continue to find another store, because it was just ten minutes left for me to catch the time for a working meeting in my office. I must go to work now.

Especially when I had lunch with my coworkers at a nearby restaurant, the waitress poured down a cup of hot coffee onto my back. In the entire afternoon, I did not move a step at all in case I encountered another thing with bad luck. I was just waiting for the end of this day.
Finally, after a long and difficult day, I returned home to find that my air conditioner was broken. I could not take it anymore! It had been the worst day of my life, and I did not want anything else to happen. I rushed to the garbage can and dug around for the chain letter I had thrown away the day before. It was covered with coffee grounds and potato peels, but I could still read the words: ""Send ten copies of this letter to your friends and you will have good luck for a year."" I sat down at the kitchen table and began to make copies for ten of my friends. They could take their chances, but I was not going to have any more bad luck!

Before Taiwanese government started to force people to classify waste and recyle it, dealing with everyday trash was a severe problem. The government often had to find new appropriate places to bury trash and build new incinerators. However, because Taiwan is a small island and people do not accept any trash operating structures near their houses, every time when the land was announced for burying trash, that always caused a lot of people to protest. Therefore, the government made a law to ask the public to classify their wastes. Although in the beginning of conducting the policy, Taiwanese government encountered strong opposition, consequently people have agreed with the importance of classifying trash. This recycling policy not only solves the problem of dealing with a huge amount of everyday trash, but also conserved numerous resources. Almost all of the trash can be recycled until now. Only is a little amount of trash burned or destroyed. Moreover, people have to pay more money for their trash, so they have changed the ways of using resources. For instance, when they buy goods, they will consider their materials if they can be recycled or not.","Trash classification was a big issue in Taiwan around 7 years ago.

Furthermore, car emission makes this issue much more severe.

First, to alleviate this issue, a number of factories that do not abide by the current environment protection law should be closed immediately. Then new laws that set a much higher standard on emission from factories and cars should be put into practice as soon as possible. At the same time, putting a cap on the number of factories can lower the total waste in the air further. Other solutions include tax reduction in green gas as an incentive to drivers who use it.

Furthermore, we don't need to pay off the amount immediately that credit card companies pay sellers for us, which probably make us step further into a debt mire. Then we could probably save up to 30% on food expense if we have a membership card for a wholesale store, such as Costco. In addition, We could go to shopping malls regularly, where we could easily come across some postseason deals with pretty good quality but even only 10 percent of the original price.

Vacations are significant areas that you can economize. Plan ahead and book tickets in advance, usually you can get a very good deal especially for air tickets and hotel room rates therefore you will save a lot of money. 
Clothing is an important area that you spend less and save more. Buying clothing at the time of on sale, you will get the same quality clothing, but you only need pay a less expensive price. If you will take a great deal of vacations, you will save more.
Food is an area that you cannot save more. You will spend more money on buying food from grocery stores such as Giant eagle, but you will get a good price at supermarket like Walmart. If you want to buy fresh vegetables, you can go to strip district, not only you will get really fresh vegetables, but also you will get a big deal for a large numbers of kinds of vegetables. Although one purchasing cannot save more, you will save a lot of money eventually.
Coupons are also an area that can help you spend less and save more.
The second advice I will help you is using credit cards carefully. Credit cards have two sides. It is really convenient that you use your credit cards to buy almost all stuffs as long as the total expense does not surpass the credit line. But on the other side, if you do not use it carefully, the convenient credit cards also can make you falling into debt. You can restrain yourself from using your credit cards, because you should know you are spending the money that you really do not have. A number of major changes you should do will lead you to your goal-economizing.
","If you want to economize, there are many ways to do in your daily life that you could spend less and save more. The first advice I will give you is to plan carefully and think in detail. Vacations are significant areas that you can economize. Plan ahead and book tickets in advance, usually you can get a very good deal especially for air tickets and hotel room rates therefore you will save a lot of money. Clothing is an important area that you spend less and save more. Buying clothing at the time of on sale, you will get the same quality clothing, but you only need pay a less expensive price. If you will take a great deal of vacations, you will save more. Food is an area that you cannot save more. You will spend more money on buying food from grocery stores such as Giant eagle, but you will get a good price at supermarket like Walmart. If you want to buy fresh vegetables, you can go to strip district, not only you will get really fresh vegetables, but also you will get a big deal for a large numbers of kinds of vegetables. Although one purchasing cannot save more, you will save a lot of money eventually. Coupons are also an area that can help you spend less and save more. The second advice I will help you is using credit cards carefully. Credit cards have two sides. It is really convenient that you use your credit cards to buy almost all stuffs as long as the total expense does not surpass the credit line. But on the other side, if you do not use it carefully, the convenient credit cards also can make you falling into debt.

In 1992, it was the year that we won the championship in the national competition in Taiwan after years of practice and hard work. From junior high school to university, I continued to attend musical school and made new classmates and friends whom I also enjoyed practicing musical instruments with. Even though these friends are new, but they are the people that I spend the most time with. After I graduated from university and started my working life in Taiwan, it was my co-workers who I had to spend all my time to plan activities and events for my company. We became the good pals who worked hard together, went to dinner and parties together, and even went to sing karaoke together. Finally, I came to the US and left all my friends and co-workers in Taiwan behind. Here in the US I have to make new friends in the ELI who I discuss and improve English with. Even though I miss all my friends in Taiwan, but I am also having a great time here in the US because of the new friends I made. I agree with the philosopher Ralph Barton Perry that ""wherever you are it is your own friends who make your world.""",2,

I'm going to introduce myself to you. My name is Minsuk, [Last Name]. I'm going by Min. These days, I'm glad to study with my classmates. 
First of all, I was wondering when my English level can be grown, however, I'm getting better on my ability for English language because I'm studying hard since last term. I wish that I could transfer to I.S. at University of Pittsburgh ASAP.
Second, my hobby is playing soccer, so I usually enjoy playing soccer game every weekend. However, I take pleasure in a new hobby which is watching television serial drama by my laptop. Now I recommend you my interesting drama: ""How I met your mom."" If you enjoyed watching the drama for growing English, your choice would be the most effective methods.
Finally, I always dream forward to achieve my goal that becomes excellent engineer, so I want to finish this term with the result of my efforts. I think that my classmates help me (to) make a lot of opportunities nowadays.

Thank you,

Min

Actually, I knew and heard about online dating before, however, I didn't think about what should I do or don't. After I finish reading Dr. Schwartz's advices, I realize that if I really want to enjoy on-line dating, I should do and prepare to meet nice person by internet.
 The first advice that I found necessary and valuable is spending time to know someone. I think everyone who wants to experience good one-line dating have to spend enough time to express him/her self, to give specific information, and to know each other. Also, secondly impressed advice is having good attitude. In other words, being optimistic and positive is good way to experience enjoyable on-line dating. 
 Next, two advices that I don't think absolutely correct advice are being an honest person and not being a talkative person. In some cases, everyone needs a little white lie. Definitely, telling big lies is a bad habit, such as, pretending to be a millionaire or faking age, however, when the little white lies can make the situation for all better, we need to use little white lies. The last advice that I don't really agree is to not be a talkative person. Talkative person could make the mistake monopolize the conversation and not give the chance to speak. It's seriously bad and rude manner, however, if we met a really timid and shy person, we'd better be a talkative person. If we keep talking and trying to make someone relaxed, probably he/she will appreciate your effort. These are all of my opinion about Dr. Schwartz's advice.

By the time I came here, I have worked for a construction company for various engineering services related to the scheduling and planning of projects, analyzing integrated schedules for construction, and monitoring project costs and schedules in coordination with budget and building code. The reason why I became a civil engineer is because of one event. In 1994, the Sung-Su Bridge in Korea collapsed. Thirty people were killed and twenty more were injured. This event inspired me to become a civil engineer. The collapse of the Sung-Su Bridge was the result of fatigue cracks that grew in size. This accident caused enormous amounts of damage to human life and to property, and it inspired me to pursue professional qualification as a civil engineer to learn about safety techniques for structures. When I was a child, moreover, my father used to bring me photographs of the world's bridges and books concerning mechanics and construction management. This sparked my interest in civil engineering. When I grew older, I wanted to understand not only how structures were designed and built, but also how mechanics functioned to prevent structures from collapsing. I want to continue changing, refining the ways in which I approach civil engineering.","Hi, I'm Kyung Jong [Last Name]. I wanted to drop by and introduce you to my first blog.

When I was a child, moreover, my father used to bring me photographs of the world's bridges and books concerning mechanics and construction management. This sparked my interest in civil engineering. When I grew older, I wanted to understand not only how structures were designed and built, but also how mechanics functioned to prevent structures from collapsing. I want to continue changing, refining the ways in which I approach civil engineering.","Hi, I'm Kyung Jong [Last Name]. I wanted to drop by and introduce you to my first blog. I have been recently starting this blog about my my interesting field. Now, I am currently studying English at the ELI, which provides me with English skills for Academic Studies. When I arrived in Pittsburgh five months ago, I was ""fluent"" in only two words, which were 'ok' and 'thanks' in English. I was inappropriately dressed and culturally inept. Through hard work and determination, I have excelled academically, and I have initiated extracurricular involvement as I have overcome the language barrier. By the time I came here, I have worked for a construction company for various engineering services related to the scheduling and planning of projects, analyzing integrated schedules for construction, and monitoring project costs and schedules in coordination with budget and building code. The reason why I became a civil engineer is because of one event. In 1994, the Sung-Su Bridge in Korea collapsed. Thirty people were killed and twenty more were injured. This event inspired me to become a civil engineer. The collapse of the Sung-Su Bridge was the result of fatigue cracks that grew in size. This accident caused enormous amounts of damage to human life and to property, and it inspired me to pursue professional qualification as a civil engineer to learn about safety techniques for structures.

I tipped him $20 extra besides the fee. It's really surprised him. Maybe he never received so much for just a small moving. After all, my wallet let empty that day. ",2,

However, telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationships. I think people should not tell lies because not only telling lies will break our credit but we will make up more lies to complete our lies. 
First, it will break your credit if someone finds that you tell a lie. They will not believe you because you do not tell the truth. Also, it is hard to establish your credit. For example, one of my previous colleagues performed well at my company, so my supervisor believed her so much. On time, she pretend she was sick because of her laziness. She asked for a sick leave and she went to movies in a mall. Unfortunately, our supervisor made an appointment with a customer at a restaurant in the mall. They ran into at the mall. After that, my supervisor did not give her the important duties. As she said, she has not believed her anymore. 
In addition, you need to make up more lies to complete your lies. You should make up more excuses to make your lies reasonable and sometimes the make-up excuses are not believed. For instance, when I was a child, I sometimes played with my classmates after school. My parents asked me why I am home late. I just pretended my teacher asked us to stay at school. And my parents kept asking me why. I kept making up some situation. Consequently, I could not think of any excuses, so I told them the truth. I was punished because I told a lie, not I played with my classmates late. 
To conclude, I believe that people should not tell the lies. If you told a lie, you would not be trust by your friends and coworkers. And you also need more lies to make your lies reasonable and persuadable. People had better not tell lies.","Have you ever told a lie?

There are some people who say that telling the truth is the most important consideration in any relationship. However, I don't think so. Sure, telling the truth is one of the integral components to continue good relationships, but it's not always. Here are two main situations that telling the false is better than telling the truth.

First, you could tell the lie not to make it worse the relationship between you and your friend. For example, you are on a date with your girlfriend(or boyfriend). If your girlfriend asks you that you have ever had a girlfriend before her, what are you going to say? She probably wants to know about your previous girlfriend and even more of your past. Maybe You can tell her the truth, but it's not a good idea. That is because that a person, in general, wants to know about it more and more if their friend say something. In this situation, you can tell the lie instead of truth so that improve your relationship.

Second, there's a situation that telling the lie gives hope to someone. Imagine one of your closest friend has a cancer. The doctor says that there's no possibility that your friend could live and he(or she) has only a month left. Then, what can you tell your friend, who asks you about his condition? Some people may believe that telling the truth--telling him his real condition--is the best way to help him to prepare his left life. However, it could be the other way around. Most of people are frustrated when they hear that they have a cancer, finally, they give up their left life. In Contrast, the people who believe that their disease is not critical have a strong will for life. At this point, telling the truth could be a poison.

In conclusion, telling the false is sometimes better than telling the truth. Sure, in most situation, telling the truth is good. However, because the purpose of choosing telling the lie instead of truth is good, it could help to improve your relationship in some situations.","Have you ever experienced the situation that you can not tell truth to your parents or friends?

If I were going to start a business, I think I would not have the courage to use such an unconventional way as Roddick did. For example, I will not start my business when I do not have money. I think it is very dangerous to run a business without enough finance. I could not image what I should do if I failed to my business when I put all my money in my business. In addition, I think I would package my products well and delicately. I believe that elegant packaging can attract customers to buy my products. However, encouraging customers to recycle bottles or to bring containers to refill are good ways for a company to save cost and to protect our environment. Some of her ideas could be learned to operate a business, even though they might not be unconventional.

My favorite place to eat lunch in Oakland is my house. Since my house is very close to the school, I always go to my house to eat lunch. Actually there are several reasons because eating lunch in my house is more economic, authentic, and healthier.
First of all, my house is the most economic restaurant in Oakland. Every Saturday I go to Giant eagle and Korean grocery shop name of which is Seoul mart for whole week. Even if I spend the money less than 50 dollars, I can prepare wonderful lunch for whole week. I can get wonderful food for less than 5 dollars.
Second, I can eat more authentic food in my house than in restaurants. I usually cook Korean food which is more authentic than any other restaurants in Oakland. Also I have many chances to have many different authentic foods because I have many roommates who are from different countries. For example, Abin who from Nepal puts a lot of interesting spices and favors, and specially his curry is so wonderful. Also I have roommates from Ghana, Japan, and other many countries so I can get many chances to have different kinds of country foods. It was so much fun which I never experience in restaurants.
Last, I can keep my health by eating health Korean food. Korean food is more balanced than American food which is usually served in restaurants following on nutritional studies. I do not use much meat or beef and I use much vegetables. And I do not use much sugar and salt which is very bad for my health. Even if I eat in a restaurant, I should eat less healthy food than in my house. Many restaurant use a lot of sugar and salt to tempt many people.
I sure that my house is the best restaurant in Oakland because I can save my money, enjoy authentic foods, and keep my heath.

Because they just did it in order to run away from a weird guy whom they met in a bar. Grissom and Catherine found one picture that was torn half away in the dead person, Dasilva's house. With the picture, he could found one man who was used to be an intimate friend with Dasilva. Because they could see earrings in the edge of the picture, and a manager of the restaurant, which Nick took them, could recognize whose earrings were. By checking the footprints of the suspect, whose name was Applewhite, they were able to have a confidence that he must have been a murderer.",2,

Armageddon, featuring Bruce Willis, is a story about saving the Earth. One day in America, a big rock fell from the sky. This rock was only a piece from a giant-size-rock, which was coming toward the Earth. Therefore, NASA, which is a company of scientists who researches the universe, came up with a plan to make a hole at the rock and use nuclear bomb to change the track of the rock. Bruce Willis, who works in an oil company, was brought to be the captain of a digging team. Two teams are lined up and they went to the space. Unfortunately, only one space ship that Bruce Willis was taking arrived there safely. It was not easy to dig a hole. Thus, they faced into a problem that their tools were broken. At that moment, another space ship crew arrived to support them. Finally, they finished digging a hole, but remote control of nuclear bomb was broken. The crews had a vote to pick up one person to press the button, which will make explosion. Unluckily, his daughter's lover was selected. Consequently, Bruce Willis decided to stay to activate the bomb. The one hero, who loved his daughter, saved the Earth.","My favorite movie is 'Armageddon', which I watched more than 5 times.

But the other reason is I hate to wait for a bus. Sometimes it takes me 15 minutes to wait for a bus, although it only takes 20 minutes to walk to school. My home city is Taipei, in the north of Taiwan. It is the capital city of Taiwan. On the other hand, Pittsburgh is in the east of U.S. and an old city. There are several differences between Taipei and Pittsburgh. Taipei is a very convince city, however Pittsburgh is not as convince as Taipei. I can tell you why via transportation, convince stores, restaurants.
 Taipei`s transportation is more convince than Pittsburgh. There is a MRT system in Taipei. Most of people who live in Taipei use MRT as their main transportation. Because there is no traffic jam and traffic light in MRT. You do not need to wait for the MRT more than 5 minutes. It comes ever 5 minutes or in the rush hour it comes ever minutes. We can take the MRT to most of places which we want to go, while in Pittsburgh, the bus is the only one way that I can use. I need to check the bus schedules and wait for the bus for a long time. 
 The convince stores are pull of the Taipei city. You can see the convince stores every block. In contrast, you can rarely see a convince store here. We can buy a cake or presents in convince store in Taipei. They sell everything there. But in here you can only buy food or drink here. Most of us buy our food supplies in the stores but in Pittsburgh they buy the food in supermarket.
 There are a lot of restaurants in Taipei, you never feel hungry there. And a large amount of restaurants close at midnight and open in the early morning. It is different from Pittsburgh. However, if you are hungry in the midnight in Pittsburgh, you only can go to bar or something like that. It is very different from Taipei.
 Taipei is very different from Pittsburgh. You can go everywhere without waiting, you can go to the convince store near your house instead of going to supermarket which is far away from your home.

Since I came to America, I have realized that there are many cultural differences which are base on different cultural factors between Korean and American. So I would like to discuss two differences which are American's individual life and working style.
First of all, American pursue individual life, otherwise Korean is more tend to be together. I went to restaurant with American and when we got the receipt that we ordered, I thought that we could separate same amount of money for total money. But American started to calculate their own order and tip for each person individually. It looked so complicated and I did not understand at that time. In Korea, people go to restaurant and order and share food together. Also when Korean pays their order, they just separate same amount of money each person. In addition to, usually order people pay for younger people's order and man pay for women's order. 
Second, Korean tend to do as fast as they can, American takes their own time enough. At the airport, I waited for getting boarding pass. Even though the line was long and many waited, staff worked very slowly and carefully each customer. In Korea, every thing is so fast so people can not wait long time. Since I was used to Korean working style, I could not wait easily. But after many experiences in American life, I realized both American and Korean ways to work have advantage and disadvantage. Fast work is not good every times. Slow work can make them more accuracy and customer can get enough care from staff.
I have been learning many cultures since I came to America. And I realize that one culture can not judge by different cultures. There are just differences and not right or wrong for different cultures.","Since I came to America, I have realized that there are many cultural differences which are base on different cultural factors between Korean and American.

Y,S317,18680,en1,Spanish,Male,385,4,w,2563,1,414,413,413,"The rivers Monongahela and Allegheny in Pittsburg and Daule and Babahoyo
in Guayaquil are components more relevant in the beautiful scenarios where
these cities born some centuries ago. But, each city has it own identity
with differences and similarities. In this essay, I will try to establish
from my personal perspective some contrasts between them about weather,
organization city and their people.

My first category of comparison is the weather. Pittsburgh is located in
north hemisphere and his weather is affected by the climatic changes of
the countries located to the north of Tropic of Cancer. This fact makes
that Pittsburgh has four seasons during the year. In contrast, Guayaquil
is sited a few mills at south of the equator line which does that only two
seasons, dry and rain, happen every year. The factor ""weather"" has
advantages and disadvantages for both cities. One example of this can be
one person living in Guayaquil never see snowing upon the houses but the
same person neither will pay high cost for house calefaction during the
winter.

The climate of both cities has given specific characteristics in the
organization of the city and my second point is to describe how Pittsburgh
and Guayaquil are organized. Pittsburgh has an excellent system of public
transportation, schedule on time and many routes distributed across of the
city. Likewise, Guayaquil is developing an efficient transport system
which includes bus stops in specific places with commodity and safe. Other
valid point is the cleaning of the two cities. Both Pittsburgh and
Guayaquil have been committed in the decreasing of the pollution and
contamination of environment in the last decade. It seems that the bad
fame of dirty cities that they got in the past is being buried in the
forgetfulness. Even though, both cities share these similarities, some
differences are evident. While Pittsburgh has several tourist places,
Guayaquil has just two or three tourist locations for visitors.

Finally, my third point is about the people in both cities. People from Pittsburgh are diverse. Chinese, Indians and Afro-Americans are the groups most notorious into the city. They live in harmony with the group majority which is white American. In another hand, Guayaquil is not diverse. All people has the racial characteristics and the communities of Chinese and Indians are not many.

In conclusion, both cities are defined by their weather, climate and organization. Pittsburgh and Guayaquil are two cities growing up on the correct way of the friendship, prosperity and leadership.","The rivers Monongahela and Allegheny in Pittsburg and Daule and Babahoyo in Guayaquil are components more relevant in the beautiful scenarios where these cities born some centuries ago.

This fact makes that Pittsburgh has four seasons during the year. In contrast, Guayaquil is sited a few mills at south of the equator line which does that only two seasons, dry and rain, happen every year. The factor ""weather"" has advantages and disadvantages for both cities. One example of this can be one person living in Guayaquil never see snowing upon the houses but the same person neither will pay high cost for house calefaction during the winter. The climate of both cities has given specific characteristics in the organization of the city and my second point is to describe how Pittsburgh and Guayaquil are organized. Pittsburgh has an excellent system of public transportation, schedule on time and many routes distributed across of the city. Likewise, Guayaquil is developing an efficient transport system which includes bus stops in specific places with commodity and safe. Other valid point is the cleaning of the two cities. Both Pittsburgh and Guayaquil have been committed in the decreasing of the pollution and contamination of environment in the last decade. It seems that the bad fame of dirty cities that they got in the past is being buried in the forgetfulness. Even though, both cities share these similarities, some differences are evident. While Pittsburgh has several tourist places, Guayaquil has just two or three tourist locations for visitors. Finally, my third point is about the people in both cities. People from Pittsburgh are diverse. Chinese, Indians and Afro-Americans are the groups most notorious into the city. They live in harmony with the group majority which is white American. In another hand, Guayaquil is not diverse. All people has the racial characteristics and the communities of Chinese and Indians are not many. In conclusion, both cities are defined by their weather, climate and organization. Pittsburgh and Guayaquil are two cities growing up on the correct way of the friendship, prosperity and leadership.","The rivers Monongahela and Allegheny in Pittsburg and Daule and Babahoyo in Guayaquil are components more relevant in the beautiful scenarios where these cities born some centuries ago.

 First of all, what is wrong with having cell phone? Scientists were concerned that people have a cell phone because they demonstrated how the cell phone influences people. For examples, Prof. Henry Lai(1999), a research professor in the UW's bioengineering department, has linked diminished long-term memory and navigating skills in rats with exposure to microwaves like those from cellular telephones. Also, in 2004, William Stuart, an officer of government in the U.K., denied that the microwaves influenced teenager's brain. However, the problems have been reduced currently due to technology developing rapidly. Many companies make and sell cell phones in the world and then try to be the foremost company in the volatile cell phone market. Therefore, the companies answered their customers' demands. As a result, some companies fixed the problem. For instance, the companies made a cell phone without antenna. However, they didn't clearly settle the problem yet. 
 Second, why do people use cell phones regardless of the problem? After the end of the 20 century, we ought to have a cell phone. This is because the cell phone helps to maintain relationships with people continuously. For examples, we can easily talk with someone on the street by using a cell phone and then, we can talk with a friend who lives on the opposite side of the world. Also, it is helpful in a business. For example, if a company modifies a contract, another company should know the problem directly because the company should accomplish the contract. At that time, the cell phone is very helpful because they can share information with each other by cell phone. So, most workers had better have the cell phone for their business. 
 In conclusion, these days, we can check our e-mail inbox and watch movies on the phone. So, people know that we should have cell phones for a convenient life, with the exception of a few people. Therefore, I think people use cell phones despite their awareness of the problems.

Then, the reading explains why they attempt to attract the young and the details about how to influence the young. Since millions adult smokers either kick their habit or die each year, the cigarette industry depends on attracting new customers. The methods are various and effective, including pervasive influenced tobacco advertisement, such as direct TV show, underlying brand-stretching, such as sports sponsorship, easy access, such as free cigarette in the places where high-school students like to hang out, sale of false America lifestyles, as if most Americans smoke, and friends in high places, which means sell cigarette through politic pressure. At the end of the reading, the author ask people who think that it's wrong for the United States to promote the sale abroad of cigarette to write a letter to the President, and urge him to support curbs on tobacco advertising in other countries like those already in place here.
Everyone has double standards; such as mothers always have bias on their children. So, I am not very surprised with the fact in this reading. However, I won't support the author. Imagining such situations, if America government really curbs on tobacco advertising in other countries like those already in America, and the result of this has a greatly bad effect in the author's life, does the author still support his ideas? An old Chinese saying said, when you are full and stay in warm, you look grace and desire more; on the contrary, when you are hungry and cold, you maybe want to steal. In my opinion, I think the important point should focus on how the other countries deal with this situation. One can't depend on another's kindness to get better live. Such as the example in the reading, Japan, I don't think Japan should depend on America's kindness that not to impose tobacco advertising on them. They should be stronger to say no to such pressure. Otherwise, even in this case, America maybe make a concession, there might still have another similar case. Maybe external causes would have a big effect, but the determined elements are internal causes. In a conclusion, I think the most efficient way to solve cigarette problem is other countries government, such as China, should guide their people not to be attracted by tobacco advertising.

How have you been these days? This is the first time that I write a letter to you. I am going to tell you about my typical day. First of all, I get up about 5:50 a.m. After showering and having breakfast, I prepare to go to the school. I go out home at 8:20 a.m., get together with Hwasoon, an ELI student, about 8:30 a.m. and come along with her to the school. We talk about our homework or our life in Pittsburgh while we come to the school. Even immediately before I come in the classroom, I chat with her. Then, I take 5 ELI classes from 10:00 a.m. to 3:50 p.m. During the classes, I hand in my homework to my teacher almost everyday. After class, I come back home about 5:00 pm. After having dinner and washing dishes, I light up my desk. While I do my homework, I enjoy chatting with my friends in Korea by MSN or NateOn messenger. Around 11:00 p.m., I turn off the light and go to bed. I want to know your typical day. Please send it to me by the reply to this letter. Good night and see you tomorrow!!

Did you spent a wonderful holiday? 
I spent my whole holiday with my family. Monday was the best. Early in the morning we went to picnic. We went to Morain Park to ride a bicycle to see a beautiful fall foliage. The fee for bicycle riding was expensive. We laid out $35. Although it was expensive it was worth to pay. I have never seen this beautiful roads like there. Yellow, red, green and orange colors together did the scene up. We really played around! It was little bit difficult to keep some distance away while riding bicycle together. My younger brother keep up to be at the first. So that solved a bicycle jam between our 5 family members. All of our family members felt having a hard work out that morning. After 1 hour for riding, we drop by outlet mall nearby the park to pick some winter clothes up. We also had a great time in there too. Shopping is always enjoyable.
I strongly recommend you to go Morain Park too. 
See you soon. Bye.

Hi Gina
The last months were busy and tired but everything lay on. I fixed up my new apartment, that was a big problem, Not having a car is so strange I have to rent one every time when I need to pick up new things. I really miss my car now and all the furniture here is disassemble. I had to put all the pieces together, which took me double the time, but all the effort paid off because I did my apartment up. I love it now.
My days are completely full, I wake up at 7:30 am in the morning; you know I need to run to start my day. I try to run for 1 hour after that I go back to home, them I check my email, I read some on line newspapers from Chile looking news up of public policies. I get on the bus at 9:30, because my classes start at 10 AM.
Mondays and Thursdays are the worst days because I spent all my day at the University I don't go back to my house until 7:30 PM. Tuesdays and Fridays are better because I go back to home at 4:00. Wednesdays are my free day but they aren't really free. I spend all day cleaning up, putting stuff back, throwing garbage out and buying groceries. I'm so tired I really need someone to help me out with all the work in the apartment.
Where were you last Monday? I call you up but nobody answered me. you have to call me back soon I have great news for you.
Anyway, see you soon, I'm waiting for you visit.

Also of the 152 students 63% are male and 37% are female. All classroom instructors hold master's degrees in linguistics or in teaching English as a Second Language, or are in the process of earning such degrees, all instructors are native or near-native speakers of English.

The Jiaozi is a common Chinese dumpling. It is usually small so you can easily eat. It is a piece of dough filled with something, so you can make them at different shape. They can be round, square, triangle or any other shape you like. It is cooked in water. Its stuffing usually includes minced meat and chopped vegetables. For the minced meat, you can use ground pork, ground beef, ground lamb or shrimp. For the vegetables, you can use any kind of vegetables you like. Of course, the stuffing can only be vegetables.

Y,K2273,21995,as7,Korean,Female,426,4,w,2890,1,407,402,402,"Nowadays, the people who live in the city suffer from the various diseases. Some of these illnesses have been emerged recently and 'Insomnia' is one of them. In the Wikipedia, which is an online encyclopedia, defines it; Insomnia is a symptom of a sleeping disorder characterized by persistent difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep despite the opportunity. It is typically followed by functional impairment while awake. In addition, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in year 2007, approximately 64 million Americans suffer from insomnia on a regular basis each year. There might be some advices to help them by being careful indoors and outdoors. 
First of all, people can avoid insomnia easily by doing some activities in their house. Before going to bed, taking warm bath helps them sleep well because it reduces the fatigue and make the blood circulate better. Then, read some of the light book. It can be a novel, but most patients try to sleep by reading their religious books. Even though they can't fall asleep, drinking a cup of warm milk is also one of the good ways. It will make them feel comfortable and relaxed so that they can get to sleep quickly.
The other solutions take places outside of the house. For example, if people move, such as walking, running and exercising more than the current, it makes their blood circulate and the body can be energetic during the day. These exercises might be tough at the first time. However, even if people get tired and the sleepiness comes, they shouldn't take it. It can affect their sleep badly at night because they've already done. If someone really wants to sleep in the daytime, go outside and get some fresh air or chat with somebody. These will make him/her feel better. In addition, Doctors can also give some professional advices or medicines. Perhaps, this is not the best way, but can be the fastest way.
In conclusion, People should think about their behaviors which are inside and outside of the house. Taking warm bath, reading a book and drinking a cup of milk before sleeping can be done indoors, and making more movements, avoiding taking a nap and having an appointment with a doctor can be taken outdoors. If people adapt these solutions and try to do them, it's pretty sure that they're able to come out of the insomnia soon.","Nowadays, the people who live in the city suffer from the various diseases.

The genre of this movie is thriller and action, which is the most interesting genre. The reason why I like this kind of movie is that it makes me tense all through screening. The synopsis of ""Taken"" is that a girl whose age was seventeen years old was kidnapped in Europe. Her father who was an intelligence man in secret agent went to Europe to find his daughter during three days. He just had a few clues, because he knew her kidnap when they were speaking over the phone. He tried to find her using his knowledge and information related with his job. Finally, he found her from the traffickers of human being before she was sold by prostitute. Also, they who kidnapped her were killed by him. He and his daughter went to back their home without any accidents. If he could not find his daughter within 72 hours, he must have never found her because the kidnappers sold people to all over the world.

Although Memorial Day is a national holiday in America for remembering solders who died in the past wars, American would like to spent time doing activities with their families or friends now a days. They like cooking Barbecues, traveling to other places, or having parties. As an international student, I asked myself what I was going to do in this three-day holiday. No classes, I decided to take this good opportunity to do my own works. 

I had a very tiring Saturday. In the morning, I participated in gardening activity in the Garden near the big dinosaur. It took me approximately four hours to help gardener move weeds and plan flowers. At the beginning I enjoyed talking with my classmate while I was doing it. Two hours later, I was totally tired of it. When they asked me to finish the last section of work, I felt terrible because I thought the more we did the more we were going to do next. After coming back home on 12pm, I took a quick bath, and then I slept until 5pm. I felt exhausted in the evening. Finally, I asked my husband to order pizza for the dinner instead of cooking by myself.

I felt more cheerful on Sunday. In the early morning, I had a significant chat with my previous colleague on line, who was one of my team members unlikely to talk with me at that time. She told me she missed me a lot and gave me a meritorious feedback on my past work. I was so glad to have her opinion even it happened three months after I left China. After finishing our breakfast, I borrowed lawnmower from the neighbor and asked my husband to mow the grasses in front of our house. While he was doing his work outside, I was doing my laundry in basement. Later in the afternoon, I started preparing our dinner, which included baking lamp with onion, mixing salad with rice. My husband and I enjoyed our dinner so much.

Since Monday is the Memorial Day, my husband and I went to the Soldiers and Sailors National Military Museum & Memorial in the afternoon. While I was visiting the museum, seeing the letters wrote by the solders during the war moved me. I think it is necessary to demonstrate the war by using these materials, such as maps, guns, photos etc, because they would draw a real picture to us and helped us to memory the war unforgettable. I expect we are not going to have any war in the future because nothing is more important than human beings' life.

In the end of the holiday, I really did plenty of activities within these tree days, busy as a bee. Actually, I did enjoy my three-day holiday. It was a chance to participate outside activities as well as spend time with family. More over, living in America, I tried to experience American living style, which helped me to understand American cultural and history.

 Memories Day is a national holiday. People remember soldier who was dead in war, but it's my funny holiday in America. In this weekend we ate the Japan buffet and went shopping in the Ross Park Mall. Besides, we went to the farm near Pittsburgh. There are so many animals and picnic in there. Actually, I used my form to celebrate this Day.

 Because we're bored in fast food, we ate the Japan buffet on Saturday. There are so many kinds Japan foods in there. Compared with fast food, it's very delicious and not expensive. After lunch, we went to the Ross Park Mall and went shopping. In this time, so many stores are on sale, we bought some clothes in A&F, American Eagle. In addition, we bought a cake in the Cheese Chocolate Factory. I heard people say that they have very delicious cakes. In the evening, Mark called me and told me a very terrible thing. He said that the seller forgot to unlock the clothes security which he bought. Due to this situation, I thought we need to come back to shopping mall again tomorrow.

 On Sunday Mark called me and woke up me at 8:00, it's very early. He was hurried about his clothes and complained about the sellers. We looked for the other A&F store and went to the waterfront. We drove the car by GPS. I thought that everything was fine, but it's the start of our trouble. We spent two hours to find the correct way to Waterfront, even if the Waterfront is very close to the Oakland. We got lost. I didn't want to remember doing this stupid thing and I don't believe the GPS again. Whatever we arrived to Waterfront and played some games in the D&B. Mark made the sellers unlock his clothes security. I thought he was very happy. In the afternoon, we went back to school did my homework. In the evening, because my friend came back to Taiwan, I have to take care about their cats. I watched TV and accompanied with the cats. It was a very lazy night, but I like this feeling.

 On Monday we went to the farm with the ELI's classmates. The most important thing was that I knew the new friends and went to the outdoor activity. At 9:00, we bought to the subway and went to the farm near Pittsburgh. Julie set up this activity and we have a chance to visit there. There are so many animals in there and played the soccer. Besides, we met the little girl and her family. Somebody accompanied with the little girl and draw with her. She was very cute and we talked with her family. I thought it's good for us to train our English. I liked the meadow and sunny day. We can lie on the meadow and breathed fresh air. Nothing is better than this. It's my exciting holiday on Memories day.

 In this weekend we acquired so much experience in buying clothes. When you bought your clothes, remember to check the security lock of your clothes. Besides, I thought I have a very exciting weekend. We ate the delicious Japan buffet, went shopping in the shopping mall, and we had a very wonderful picnic.

 Do you know the meaning of Memorial Day? Memorial Day supposed to be remembering about the soldiers who gave their precious life in the war for our future. However these day people celebrate this holiday by barbeque or going out instead of remembering. Also you can get three weekends in this holiday. That's why lots of people travel like I did. I went to the New York City during the three holidays. 
 
 On Saturday I arrived in New York City. As soon as took off the train in Time Squire, I went to the TKTS to buy my tickets for today show. Fortunately, I could buy CHICAGO ticket that was discounted 50 percents off. The show stated 2p.m. I had more than 2 hours before the show starting. So I went to the Empire State Building while I was waiting the show. I could see the Midtown and Central Park in the top of the building. It was great experience. Then I went to the theater to see CHICAGO. Although I didn't understand all of thing what they were talking, I could get main idea of the story.

 On Sunday early morning, I went to Battery Park to take a Ferry, which went to the Statue of Liberty. The tickets for going up to the Statue of Liberty was sold out. So I couldn't go up there. However I can get on the Ferry that go to the Ellis Island where the Statue of Liberty is. After I went to the World Trade Centers, which are collapsed by terrorism. I felt sorry to see that. And then I went to SOHO. It's fantastic place for shopping. I felt like that I could stay there 24 hours.

 Monday morning I got in the City Tour Bus. It went around Upper East, Upper West and Central Park. I got off in the Central Park. I was surprised when I hear that Central Park made automatically. Afternoon I got on the board ""Circle Line"". It went around Hudson River through the Manhattan. New York City is wonderful. I wish I would come here again.

 My Memorial Day was wonderful. I saw many things in this weekend during the trip to New York City. I could see one of the biggest city's culture, history and life style. Three days is too short to see all of things in New York City. If I have a change I would like to go New York City again.

It went around Hudson River through the Manhattan. New York City is wonderful. I wish I would come here again. My Memorial Day was wonderful. I saw many things in this weekend during the trip to New York City. I could see one of the biggest city's culture, history and life style. Three days is too short to see all of things in New York City. If I have a change I would like to go New York City again. ","Do you know the meaning of Memorial Day? Memorial Day supposed to be remembering about the soldiers who gave their precious life in the war for our future. However these day people celebrate this holiday by barbeque or going out instead of remembering. Also you can get three weekends in this holiday. That's why lots of people travel like I did. I went to the New York City during the three holidays. On Saturday I arrived in New York City. As soon as took off the train in Time Squire, I went to the TKTS to buy my tickets for today show. Fortunately, I could buy CHICAGO ticket that was discounted 50 percents off. The show stated 2p.m. I had more than 2 hours before the show starting. So I went to the Empire State Building while I was waiting the show. I could see the Midtown and Central Park in the top of the building. It was great experience. Then I went to the theater to see CHICAGO. Although I didn't understand all of thing what they were talking, I could get main idea of the story. On Sunday early morning, I went to Battery Park to take a Ferry, which went to the Statue of Liberty. The tickets for going up to the Statue of Liberty was sold out. So I couldn't go up there. However I can get on the Ferry that go to the Ellis Island where the Statue of Liberty is. After I went to the World Trade Centers, which are collapsed by terrorism. I felt sorry to see that. And then I went to SOHO. It's fantastic place for shopping. I felt like that I could stay there 24 hours. Monday morning I got in the City Tour Bus.

 I have several exciting memories about my first holidays in the United States. Since I came at Pittsburgh, I had initally holiday that is memorial day. Actually, I have never spend a lot of time to enjoy looking around Pittsburgh. However, I could have a good time during last three days such as going shopping, hving a trial ride, and going to amusement park.

 One day, we went to a Kia car center to buy a new car with our acquaintances, I could see many fantastic cars that I want to buy. I firstly saw various new cars directly as well as enjoyed a good test drive. Right after, we went to shopping to buy some clothes at Waterfront. I looked around many clothes and then I bought a short pant that is orange color. 

 On our second day, we went to Kennywood around Waterfront. At first, it seemed like a smaller amusement park than others. However, when I actually entered there, I could see a lot of adventure rides such as biking, zirodrop, and so on. Even though, we waited to ride a biking for a long time, we felt satisfied as much as waiting. I would like to go to Kennywood frequently.

 On third day, we spent our free time talking about our American life and a few goals that we hace to achieve in 5 years. We currently are adapting ourself to Pittsburgh's life. This city is a good place to live than I expected. It has a beautiful nature and convenient transportation, especially, I feel safer than other cities. 

 During my first holidays, I had very fantastic experiences with my husbund. As for me, the three days deserve permanent remembrance.","I have several exciting memories about my first holidays in the United States.

What was i going to do in my first three - day weekend in U.S.?
I have three - day weekend because was Memorial Day on Monday. Typical American people make barbecue or travel, but I 'm an international student and Memorial Day is a great opportunity to know different American people and their traditions, also I could know there are closed or simply rest. That depends only on me.

On Saturday I went to a interesting and curious party, why? Because I have one friend called Erica who knew the first day I have been here, she is American, but she have a connection with me because she has been in Chile (my country) and she will live in Chile since the next month. Therefore, last Saturday she celebrated her travel with her friend and also invited me to join. The party was in Freeport, wish is closed Pittsburgh. In the party there were many people, her parents, relatives, American friend and Chilean friend. I was talking with some Chilean in Spanish (That didn't help to improve my English) and talked with American people too (in English off course). I felt happy because I could understand lots, but I felt slow to speak when there were most of one people with me. But the most important thing was I spent a great time and felt that my listening in English is better than my speaking in English. 

On Sunday y didn't wake up late, I don't know why, but in U.S I can't sleep more than eigth hours. Therefore I took a shower, I get lunch and watched two movies. That was my exciting day.

On Monday I wanted to do some different that to watch movies or T.V. then I went walking to know Squirrel Hill. That place is beauty and has a lot o life, but Monday may 25 was Memorial Day so there are few people on street, but my walk was interesting to know the neighborhood. After I did my homework and study for reading's quiz. 

My Memorial Day was good, but I think that could be better because I don't know too much people yet. I think weekend began good with the party, but I needed to be with more people and have fun.
However Memorial Day helped me to rest and sleep a lot.
I think next time will be better than now because will know more about Americans traditions.

The distance was very hard for both so we decided to get married in march of this year, and I moved to Pittsburgh too, we have been living together since then and I feel very happy and very lucky to have found him!",2,

 The movie described the time during American Civil War and Reconstruction periods how most people straggled and survived at that hard time. Scarlett O'Hara, who was a Southern beauty from a wealthy family, was a self-centered and a strong-willed female. She always had endless hope in her heart. No matter how hard life was, she could find her way to deal with it. Rhett, who loved Scarlett very mush, was a rebellious profiteer. However, Scarlet's love with her first sight lover, whose name was Ashley Wilkes, doomed the marriage between her and Rhett failed at last.
 Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, who featured Scarlett and Rhett, are on my favorite actors and actresses' list. The movie, which received ten Academic Rewards, is considered as the greatest and most popular film in all the time. Vivien was awarded the best actress. At the end of the movie, Scarlett said, ""Tomorrow is another day"", which left the hope and imagination for the audience.

 When I was little girl before enter a primary school, I sometimes visited my grandpa' house in the country. That place always gave me various fun. There was the old fence covered with tiled roof in front of the house.  It was spreaded endlessly as if train run. I played jumping up and down the old fence. Whenever I wave the branches of a tree, birds flew in the sky in surprise. When I was bored with the playground I went to the stream which flow beneath the old fence. I used to swim in the running stream, listening a bird's chirpings, watching the brilliant sun toward me. I liked  this shiny sky and also loved rainy day. While it rains, another world was unfolded in my eyes. In the rain I played excitingly with a school of fish that swim faster along a waterway, rainy birds and colorful trees. Once the dark clouds with the strange image go away, there is rainbow hung in the sky. And Family shrine which behind My grandpa's old house makes me more excitingly. In that place, several people would prostrate theirself before the altar, wearing HanBok that is Korean traditional costume. All kinds of food and sweets that I like were full in the room. I used to sleep with a sweets in my hand and wake up in my room next morning. I am sometimes reminded of my childhood, watching children who are playing hard. The old fence as if train run, the stream with fishes and shiny or rainy sky and Family shrine that arose my curiosity without end, All these remember about My grandpa's old house have remained a special fun in my mind so far.

Before I came to Pittsburgh I had never seen the snow, but I remember that in my first week here last spring I saw snow and it was very pretty. In Colombia we do not have seasons, so the weather is always the same! Consequently, before I came to Pittsburgh I had never bought winter clothes! I bought jackets, gloves, scarves and hats. My husband told me that I will look like an Eskimo, but I do not care, because I feel afraid about the cold and I do not want to be sick for New Year because we are going to Colombia for this holiday. In addition I have never ice skated, and lots of movies show Rockefeller Center in NYC with a lot of children and people ice skating, I think it is beautiful and romantic, so I can't wait to ice skate this winter. My husband and I have not done winter sports, and we are very excited about this winter because we want to learn! We are planning to go to a resort to learn how to ski; we think we need to have this experience because it is something different for us. Obviously, we are not the best at practicing extreme sports, but we think this is one opportunity to learn something new and interesting. 
I had never had made friends from different countries around the world, and this is also something that I had never done before I came to Pittsburgh, now I have friends from China, South Korea, Lebanon, Spain, Peru, Chile and Venezuela. I have learned many things from all of them and I hope we can be friends for many years.

It was the first time I went out to eat with my roommates, so I had to stay silent, but I was very scared because it was the first time in my life that I would eat Indian food. At the beginning I had many doubts that I had to order, all meals seemed identical to me, very spicy. When it came time to order the meal, I asked the waiter if I could order a ""chicken masala"" not spicy and he of course accepted my request. When it came time to eat dinner, I had the best dinner ever. Everything was delicious, from appetizers to desserts. I enjoyed the food very much, and the dinner that began with much fear for me, ended up being a good experience. I learned that night that people should enjoy and learn about the different cultures.",2,

using. It makes a monopoly of the world's resources, ex. economy, polite, or

a native language is declining. Although, English may not ever be the most

speakers who want to learn English that don't mean abandoning the native

languages' speakers minutely try to share the world language position, for

language might be changed because the diversity of language will develop. This 

domination of some language causes 90% of 6,000 or so languages to be a 

possibility for extinction. So, this writer support argument made in the first

 This writer show examples and graph to explain and support his thinking 

about English as the second language in the world. Even though the share of

English is much larger. So, English will keep as international language. The 

common thinking from both of articles is closely related to the extinction of 

minority language. This widely used language causes minority language to have 

a danger in extinction of language, even though this is not being done on 

purpose.

This widely used language causes minority language to have a danger in extinction of language, even though this is not being done on purpose. In my opinion, the second article is more persuasive. Because the second's writer shows several examples mentioned by professional peoples and provide the graph, so it is very understandable for me to read this article.","According to this article ""English seen as co-star among global language"", multilingualism is gradually increasing and this phenomenon is natural and inevitable in much of the world. This common multilingualism is showed in the United States by the fact that nearly one of five peoples is using another language at home instead of English. This multilingualism makes other countries choose English as the second language because English is important and strong in international relation. From the graph on page 38, other language speakers will surpass English. Graddol thinks that Mandarin will be the new must-learn language in the next decade. It means that the dominant language might be changed because the diversity of language will develop. This domination of some language causes 90% of 6,000 or so languages to be a possibility for extinction. So, this writer support argument made in the first article about extinction of local language. However this situation is not an intentional purpose, but a natural need. This writer show examples and graph to explain and support his thinking about English as the second language in the world. Even though the share of people in the world who are native English speakers has been decreasing, the second language speaker with English will increase because the global share of English is much larger.

Brenton underlines that the most spoken languages eventually could eliminate those that are less spoken. Furthermore, Brenton affirms that English is growing up and explains the consequences of its linguistic domination and its cultural imperialism. With one question at the end of his article, he reveals the fear that English could be ahead of other major languages (Spanish, German, Arabian, French). ""Will English really take over other major languages?"", the author asks. 
 
On the other hand, Schmid aims to the opposite possibility. He says that new times are obligating English speakers to learn other language and that right now one of five Americans ""speaks a language other than English at home"". Schmid says that it would increase the number of other languages speakers. Schmid also illustrate with graphics that other languages (Arabic, Hindi Urdu, Spanish) would increase until reach the numbers of English speakers.

 The spring break is coming soon. Some students may go back home during this time. Others may stay in their university to complete their projects. The rest may plan for a vacation. If you have decided to take a trip, you should arrange it now. There are three crucial steps to plan for your vacation: choosing a location, finding overnight accommodations, and selecting one kind of transportation.
 First of all, you should choose a place where you want to spend your vacation. There are two choices. One is to travel abroad. For example, you may want to visit countries in Europe, such as Italy, France, the UK, Switzerland, and Germany. You can learn about different cultures from these countries. It's very convenient for traveling in Europe with the Schengen visa. There are 15 Schengen countries in Europe. The other choice is to travel to other cities in the States. For instance, you may want to visit New York, Las Vegas, San Francisco, or Miami. Every city has its own characteristics. Besides, you do not have to apply any visa when you travel around in your own country. Therefore, no matter where you visit, it will be a wonderful memory. 
 Secondly, searching for overnight accommodations is also essential. Normally, people book valuable hotels on some travel websites. You can also keep a budget by naming your own price. You should notice that when you bid for your hotel, the only thing you can choose is the area of the city. You can not choose which hotel you want to live. However, it may be hard to find a low-priced hotel in a major city, like in New York. Therefore, you can look for someone who sublets his apartment for a period of time. It is believed that you will save money when you get a sublet from others. Although living in a sublet is cheaper than a hotel, it is not as comfortable as living in a hotel.
 Finally, transportation is thought to be another key factor. Most major cities have public transportation, such as buses, trains, or subways. It is an efficient way to save money when you travel on public transportation. In addition, you can buy an unlimited number of subway and bus rides for a fixed price in most of the major cities in the US. You can save some money when you buy a week ticket. On the other hand, you may want to rent a car when you are in the countryside. Although it costs much more than using the public transportation, it is more convenient to go any place you are interested in. Furthermore, you do not have to waste your time waiting for the public transportation.
 In conclusion, location, accommodations, and transportation are the three main choices you should make when you plan for a trip. Because there is a lot of information on the internet, you should plan for a trip thoughtfully. Then you will have a lot of fun during the trip.

Y,K3011,32519,ha2,Korean,Female,638,5,w,4276,1,638,637,637,"People get a vacation at least once a year and they want to enjoy it. A vacation is a special sweet reward to refresh people from their study or work and it gives you an unforgettable memory and a valuable experience. Therefore, people want their vacation to be well organized and planned. There are several steps to plan a vacation successfully. 
 First, make a list of places where you want to go by searching for information. Usually, you can get a lot of information through the internet. There are web sites of travel agencies, on-line travel clubs, and photos and information posted by real people who want to share their experiences in their blogs. They will tell you about the price, distance, and attractions. Collect all of them and make a list from your choices. 
 Second, decide the place and time by comparing and analyzing the places that you wrote down on the list. You should evaluate which place is more appropriate for your vacation. The price, climate, and distance should be considered. For example, if you want to go to the Yellow Stone National Park, you should check out it is available because the Yellow Stone Park is closed from November to April due to its coldness and snow. If you checked out all of the information and compared and analyzed, you should make up your mind where you will have a fantastic vacation.
 Third, make a schedule by searching for specific information. Creating an itinerary is one of the most crucial processes and exciting parts because you can make your own schedule. Usually, an itinerary can be diverse depending on your interests. For example, Florida is a beloved place where people want to visit their vacation. However, there are several different points of attractions such as Disney World in Orlando, Miami, and Key West. If you are interested in amusement parks, you will stay in Orlando more than in Miami. On the other hand, if you want to enjoy the beach, you will prefer to stay in Miami or Key West. Therefore, you should search about your destination thoroughly and select specific places to go. 
 Fourth, start making all necessary reservations. There are several websites which compare prices, so you can see the whole prices to decide hotels, airplanes and rental cars within your budget. If you reserve them earlier, they are usually cheaper.
 Fifth, pack the suitcase. Pack as much you will need for the vacation. If you take too many clothes, you will be tired whenever you carry the suitcase due to its weight. On the other hand, if you take only a few clothes, you cannot handle the weather change which might happen. Also, don't forget to take a first aid kit, pajamas and hygiene items. However, if you take an airplane for your trip, you cannot bring more than 100 ml of liquid items into the plane. Therefore, you have to clarify how many items you will bring and how they will be carried. 
 Finally, ask your trustworthy neighbor or family member to collect your newspapers and mail for safety. If your newspapers and mail are piled much, it indicates obviously that your house is empty so, it could be attacked by a thief. In addition, if you have a pet such as a dog or a cat, you should find someone who will take your pet because most hotels and restaurants prohibit pets from entering.
 In conclusion, planning a vacation requires several steps such as searching about the places where you want go, making an itinerary and reservations, packing the suitcase, and asking somebody to care for your home while you are traveling. A well organized and prepared plan for a vacation leads you to a successful vacation by reducing the trial and error and helping you to save money.

 The finding an apartment in Pittsburgh is too difficult to someone who can't speak English very well. In my case, I moved a new apartment 3 month ago. So I want to advice someone who want to move apartment. After you decide to move out, you should use internet,talk with your friends who knows information of apartment, and find information on wall or someplace such as bus stations.

Y,C2314,32911,ar8,Chinese,Female,618,4,w,4294,1,454,450,450,"Can you define the meaning of happiness? I feel it's hard to explain. In my opinion, happiness is an abstract thing, because it's a feeling and a subjective sensation. Sometimes people feel happy easily, but sometimes they try very hard to search for happiness. I think to be happy we could try to do the following: we should actively discover happiness, cherish the things we already have, and share the happiness with other people.
 I believe happiness exists around us all the time, but we should actively discover it. You may face some difficulties, which will make you feel disappointed. However, you can always learn from the difficulties and even failures to get valuable experiences. For example, when I first started to learn classic music, I was told that my body was not strong enough to sing as a soprano. I was sad first, but I decided to face this problem and started to take many physical exercises. The exercises were very hard, but I felt really happy that I could improve every day. After rigorous training, I successfully passed the auditions of music schools. I was so happy that the person told me my weakness, so that I could face it and correct it. This experience taught me that we should always actively find happiness even under difficult situations, and sometimes overcoming a difficulty could bring tremendous happiness. 
 People always pursue the things they don't have, and overlook the things they already have. Sometimes people complain why other people feel happy but I don't. You should ask yourself some questions. Is there somebody who often calls you and worries about you? Do you have some family members who always love you and take care of you? Sometimes you become used to the caring from your family and friends, and then you take it for granted. If you appreciate their concern, you will realize how lucky you are, and it will make you feel happy. 
 Sometimes people around you can share and even enhance your experience of happiness. For example, if you achieve something, and your family and friends can share the excitement and joy with you, you will feel much happier. An athlete who just won an Olympic gold medal would feel extremely happy, because it is not only a personal accomplishment, but also an achievement shared by his whole nation. So it is important for us to share our happiness, because it not only makes other people happy, it can also make ourselves feel happier.
 Each individual feels happy for different reasons. But as long as we actively discover happiness, cherish what we already have and share the happiness with other people, we will have a happy life.

Y,K3038,33077,an5,Korean,Female,618,4,w,4294,2,295,292,292,"    Some people pursue property or power to be happy. These things could give me comfort however, they can't make me happy because I'm affected by emotional things rather than treasures. The greatest one of them is a person who I love and also who loves me. The reasons that falling in love brings happiness to me are that it stimulates me to be better, changes my perspective to be positive, and gives me precious memories.

     First, when I'm falling in love, I keep trying to improve myself in all aspects. For instance, not only do I tend to make myself attractive, but I get more conscious of what I should achieve for my future. Because of these changes, I can be intense and alive every moment, and it definitely contributes to my happiness.

     Moreover, the world through my eyes also changes to be positive. The biggest reason is I have no room to complain about things that are not related to me directly since my mind is full of love. Once I start to look at the world positively, nothing can make me unhappy.

     Last, love always leaves valuable memories. These memories can be a special anniversary which is applied to only couples, and also can be everyday which was just boring daily life before. I especially feel happy by recalling my past days that I was with my lover. Therefore, love, creating limitless memories, is always main happiness for me. 

     To sum up, when I love someone, I modify my perspective from slight to significant things, take everything in a positive view, and acquire a lot of memories. All these things motivate me to be happy in individual ways. For this reason, falling in love most impacts on making me happy.

 Love is a happiness' partner because both are similiar feelings. Furthermore, the word 'love' includes several sides (specially in English), not only the affection for the other half, but friendship, tastes, etc. And whatever you please and like makes you happy.
 Money itself doesn't have any value, but it's a key which open lots of doors. As someone said, money doesn't give you happiness, but provide you a very similar feeling. However, the virtue is on the middle and an excess money could turn a problem (by the way, an everlasting happiness must be terrible too).

 An optimistic philosophy helps you find happiness in your life. If you have a positive attitude, it always guarantees happiness.

After that, the second thing that changed were my plans because before I decided to move to America the only things that were important to me were to take care of  my son and to work. Now I returned to the university and I'm studying English. I was a young mother and for that reason I didn't have time to learn new things but now I'm learning a new language, about other cultures and meeting new people and that made me very and proud.
Finally, I will talk about my future and the big change that will take place. I'm divorced and before I met Matt I never thought to get married again but God had other plan for us. When our relationship became really close and strong we understood that God did everything so that we were happy and therefore we needed to make new plans and get married and start a new family based on faith and his ways.
In summary, the last two years of my life made me change. I'm really happy now and everybody around me can see my new lifestyle. In other words, they can see my new mood, plans and future. It has been amazing to be in love.

Grey's Anatomy, of which I heard before, was popular in America. This was a story about some surgery interns. Meredith , Cristina, George and Izzie, who just left medical schools, met in the same group when they started their internship. Their supervising doctor, very strict, gave them many rules. All of them, excited first, faced a lot of difficulties. For example, George got a chance to perform an appendectomy, a minor operation, but he didn't complete it. Cristina, an Asian American, really wanted to do an operation and almost got the chance. She and Meredith helped an attending doctor make the correct diagnosis for a patient in critical condition. But the attending doctor, who had a one night stand with Meredith, decided to give the chance to Meredith instead of Cristina. Cristina was angry and sad. Fortunately, this situation didn't hurt their friendship. After the first 48-hour shift, the interns, having experienced complicated emotions, were exhausted. However, they reaffirmed their devotion to medicine. I was attracted, because this sitcom includes many thrilling and exciting stories, and provides exquisite details of the characters' personalities and emotions. I think I will keep watching this sitcom.","I don't have time to watch a movie recently. I only saw an episode of sitcom ""Grey's Anatomy"", recommended by my friend.

For examples, Over-control and Restricting Choice, people are scheduled no matter adults or children. Parents give more details and limiting choices for kids, and tell kids to do something they should do, not they want to do. This is a culture or belief which is deeply rooted. The authors argue that time is the point: open-ended time for children to savor and explore. Don't cut or rob the moment of flow. Let children follow their inner rhythm to open the creative spirit. However, everything is not controlled by children. Ann Lewin, Director of the Capital Children's Museum in Washington, D.C., says that adults use the compulsion to push or limit children's actions. That is a good way to master adults' schedules but kill the creative spirit of children.",1,

Amabile, who was blocked her creativity in the field of art by evaluation 

pressure, one of the creativity killers which are surveillance, rewards, 

competition and so on. The magnificent thing to develop child's creativity is 

the time. However, even though children have a good chance to evolve their 

creativity in proper time, the rhythms of adults let their children quit the 

chance to expand their creativity in the middle of process. It is so natural 

that children begin to develop and ingest their creativity. Therefore adults 

should help them not to get lost what they really want to do and help get ride 

on the flow, which is ultimate state of creativity with their rhythm, instead 

of adults' rhythm.

There are many similarities between reading a book and watching a movie, in that both of them try to tell a story and give some information, but also both of them have many differences. So many directors have taken books and made many movies such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Harry Potter'. When the directors try to change from a book to a movie, they have to know what is an important factor and how to enhance a story.
 Most of all, the most advantage in a book is that the book can maximize person's imagination by revealing first a little of information about a story and finally solving all the questions about the story.
 In contrast, a director in a movie can use a lot of skills such as sounds, gestures of actors, and high-technology, which make the movie look like a reality. For example, in The Lord of the Rings as a movie, we can watch the scene in which numberless people, elves, and skeletons fight each other, which make people feel in the movie, the reality. In the book, we cannot accept the scene well, and even we feel ambiguous.","There are many similarities between reading a book and watching a movie, in that both of them try to tell a story and give some information, but also both of them have many differences.

For some people, it is unpleasant to see their favorite book made into a movie. They claim that the director didn't understand the story, that he didn't reveal some important details, or that the main character didn't resemble the character describe in the book. For me all of these statements are usually truth and that is what makes movies so interesting. It gives you the opportunity to see two points of view of a story, you own and someonelses.
For example, When I saw my favorite movie Pride and Prejudice at first I was upset because I thought they had not cast well the main actress. In the book the main character was Elizabeth, an intelligent but no so pretty girl. In the movie they chose Keira Knightley to play her. Keira in contrast is a very pretty British actress. After seeing the movie, I actually thought Keira did a good job because she has an sparkling personality like Elizabeth's.
 Another difference was the choosing of the male actors, 
Simon Woods was playing Mr. Bingley a very plesant and attractive young man, but in the movie he actually was a little goofy. I wouldn't have chance so much that character but it was funny sometimes and it made the audience laugh.

The final difference that I remember was the ending that was enhanced by the director. He made the two main character Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy get married and he ended the movie with a very romantic final kiss.","For some people, it is unpleasant to see their favorite book made into a movie.

Most countries are inevitably suffered from the economic crisis, especially financial crisis. However, the crisis brought another opportunity to my country, South Korea.

 As the world economy gets in a serious recession, there are several results of economic problems in Korea. 
 First of all, a lot of people have been laid off recently. Unfortunately, due to an economic recession, many of companies chose to reduce the number of employees. For them, lay-off is inevitable to survive, so a lot of people lost their job. 
 Second, significant numbers of young people want to be a government officer because they pursue a stable job. Instead of getting in a company, they spend 2 or 3 years to pass the exams to work at the government. Because many people prepare the exams, they face stiff competition. 
 Finally, people tend to postpone beginning the world. They usually study English for 1 year abroad, or go to grad-school. They want to maximize their abilities by further study or studying English.

Venezuelan economy is complex and unique. It is mainly dependant on the oil industry that is controlled by the government. This economic framework makes most of Venezuelan companies dependant in one way or another of the government. In the past 10 years the government has implemented drastic economical measures to manipulate the country that have affected all companies working with in the country and trigger an national economic crisis. This internal crisis has been intensified by the American housing crisis that has affected the oil price, the cash flow in global companies and has unstabilized the global economy.

As was said before Venezuelan economy is dependant in the oil prices. If the oil prices go down, the government revenues decrease as well. The problem is that the government is the biggest employer in the country, consequently if it can't pay their employees, the common action is that they devaluate the currency. That way, with the same amount of dollars they obtain more Bolivar's Fuertes (Venezuelan Current Currency), witch allows them to pay the employees. But these affect the people. It could even be consider a robbery because people work for an amount of money, and after a devaluation that high the amount of money they are receiving sometimes represents half of what they were told they would receive.

 An other consequence of the economical crises on Venezuela was the decrease of foreign investments. Many global companies were struggling to survive with make them halt their investment on Venezuela. These affected also many international subsidiaries witch had to reduce their presence in Venezuela as they stop receiving helps from their headquarters. 

 Finally, even if Venezuelan economy has been hit by a more strong internal economical crises, it was also inevitable affected by the international housing crises with help increase inflation and reduce investment on the country.","Venezuelan economy is complex and unique.

To establish the self-defense, mandatory military service is inevitable. This is one of our four unavoidable duties. So, all Korean men have to serve military service except for the special cases.

Going to the military service could be a good experience for many people since it can give us many values and tools that would help us in several situations in our life. Moreover, if our nation needs our service just because someone or another country is invading our sovereignty, it would be almost a moral obligation for us. Many times this mandatory military service is a need for the future of our country. We cannot allow that evil people such as terrorist attack and kill many innocent people.

In Colombia, there is a civil war that has produced many murders, such as politicians, priest, foreigners, children, and soldiers. In this conflict has been involved the Colombian guerrilla, paramilitaries, drug dealers, corrupt politicians, and socialist governments from other countries as the Venezuela's administration and the Ecuador's administration.

He was from Israel and he had finished his military service just few weeks before our meeting. I started to complain about the governments that oblige young man to join the armed forces. He was so mad with me, saying that every country have different needs. He spent one hour trying to convince me.

Salil was telling me that, in order to defend its borders, Israel has a constant military activity since 1948. Women and men have to enter the military when they are 18. ""And we"" Salil said, ""should be ready any time the government requires our services"". Even though he agreed with his country laws, he was telling me how he renounced his college classes, forgot the afternoons with the friends, postpone his artistic interests, and lack of things that he was dreaming about. If the government decide that a war is coming (and this is very common in Israel) they have to pack a gun instead of a bunch of books, just like Salil did.

Y,C2425,35748,gm1,Chinese,Female,642,5,w,4642,1,561,549,549,"In China, the peasants have a saying: ""The birth of a boy is welcomed with shouts of joy and firecrackers, but when a girl is born, the neighbors say nothing."" This saying reflects China has strong gender discrimination. I think this preference is a result of deep-rooted culture and belies. When my mother was pregnant, everyone said that the baby should be a boy. Of course, my parents were so happy about it. While my father was waiting outside the surgery room, the doctor went outside and said it was a daughter. My father was so upset that he could not speak for more than 3 minutes. But actually he has been treating me like his princess, his upset reveals the common preference for boys. I think this preference has lasted for more thousands years. Why this can last for so many years? I think there are many reasons: boys are much stronger than girls when they are doing farm works, boys can take care of they parents when they are old and male are necessary to carry on the family name and take care of the family spirits. In the follow paragraphs I will explain my reasons specifically.
First, boys are much stronger that girls when doing farm works. In most rural parts of China, farmers are still relying on their farm work to support their family. They need more people to do farm work to earn more money. Absolutely boys are much stronger that girls because of physical reasons. So if farmers have sons, their sons can help them with farm works and make money, while for girls they can only stay at home and do housework. This means farmers should work harder to support their family if they have daughters. So this is one reason for boy preference.
Second, sons can take care of their parents when they are old. Powerful economic factors also support son preference. Because in most rural parts of China, there is no comprehensive social security system to protect people's finical support when they get old. While sons are expected to live with their parents when they get married and give finical support. Girls will leave their family when they get married and can not contribute to the support of her parents constantly. We can see that people rely on their sons when they get old. Considering their own profits when they are old, people really want to have s son for their stable life in the future.
Third, male are necessary to carry on the family name and take care of the family spirits. If they have daughters, it means their grandsons will not have the same family name with them. Carrying on family is a crucial goal for a family. According to this old tradition in China, boys have the duty to carry on family name while girls can not accomplish this task. Carrying on family name means hope and consistent of a family.
In a conclusion, because boys are stronger than girls when doing farm work, boys can take care of their parents when they are old and boys can carry on family name, the preference for boys has lasted for thousands years. We should acknowledge that this preference has triggered many dilemmas to the society in many aspects.","In China, the peasants have a saying: ""The birth of a boy is welcomed with shouts of joy and firecrackers, but when a girl is born, the neighbors say nothing.""

I think there are many reasons: boys are much stronger than girls when they are doing farm works, boys can take care of they parents when they are old and male are necessary to carry on the family name and take care of the family spirits. In the follow paragraphs I will explain my reasons specifically. First, boys are much stronger that girls when doing farm works. In most rural parts of China, farmers are still relying on their farm work to support their family. They need more people to do farm work to earn more money. Absolutely boys are much stronger that girls because of physical reasons. So if farmers have sons, their sons can help them with farm works and make money, while for girls they can only stay at home and do housework. This means farmers should work harder to support their family if they have daughters. So this is one reason for boy preference. Second, sons can take care of their parents when they are old. Powerful economic factors also support son preference. Because in most rural parts of China, there is no comprehensive social security system to protect people's finical support when they get old. While sons are expected to live with their parents when they get married and give finical support. Girls will leave their family when they get married and can not contribute to the support of her parents constantly. We can see that people rely on their sons when they get old. Considering their own profits when they are old, people really want to have s son for their stable life in the future. Third, male are necessary to carry on the family name and take care of the family spirits. If they have daughters, it means their grandsons will not have the same family name with them. Carrying on family is a crucial goal for a family. According to this old tradition in China, boys have the duty to carry on family name while girls can not accomplish this task. Carrying on family name means hope and consistent of a family. In a conclusion, because boys are stronger than girls when doing farm work, boys can take care of their parents when they are old and boys can carry on family name, the preference for boys has lasted for thousands years. We should acknowledge that this preference has triggered many dilemmas to the society in many aspects.","In China, the peasants have a saying: ""The birth of a boy is welcomed with shouts of joy and firecrackers, but when a girl is born, the neighbors say nothing."" This saying reflects China has strong gender discrimination. I think this preference is a result of deep-rooted culture and belies. When my mother was pregnant, everyone said that the baby should be a boy. Of course, my parents were so happy about it. While my father was waiting outside the surgery room, the doctor went outside and said it was a daughter. My father was so upset that he could not speak for more than 3 minutes. But actually he has been treating me like his princess, his upset reveals the common preference for boys. I think this preference has lasted for more thousands years. Why this can last for so many years?

For most couples, they would like to have children; for most parents, they are child-centered and love their children more than themselves life. Now, in the world, most people think that to bias against female children is unreasonable and old-world. However, the antithesis is that, in some part of the world, many parents prefer to have male children rather than female children. This is an unjustified thought that has being existed for centuries. The causes of generating the unfair thought are diverse. Some parents believe that just son can be the offspring of a family to continue the family tree. Some parents have a mistaken belief that the male child will be a support for parents in the old age. Moreover, in some place, a bride will bring a large dowry to her groom's family and the bride's family will lose property by their daughters in marriage. What effects do it have on society? It's considered that there are several negative effects such as adverse condition of growing up, breaching the balance of a proportion between male and female.

First, parents who prefer to have male children may discriminate against the female children they have had. Because the female children aren't the preference of their parents, they may be neglected and lack the parental cares from their family. They might be looked like a child labor caring their younger brothers or affording housework. They cannot receive the same good education as their brothers. The female children will be in an adverse condition of growing up.

Second, parents who prefer to have male children may negate all chances that might have a female baby. As we know, modern medical technologies are very advanced. There are many approaches that can be employed to stop have a female baby. For example, ultrasound can be used to detect whether a fetus is a male or a female. The pregnant women who are son preference will choose an abortion when they know the fetus is a female. Though, the feticide is an inhumane action and a crime, it's really has happened in some places. The effect on society is to breach the balance of the proportion of males to females. Consequently, in those places, the males might compete for a female as a wife.

From past to present, female as a daughter, a wife or a mother plays a crucial role that a male cannot replace in a family; females also as a teacher, an engineer, a social worker and a scientist etc. are active in varied fields. Females as a member of societies, their positions and functions are irreplaceable. The equalities between men and women should be more widely promoted via the education, the news media to change the stereotype of son preference. Society, community and school should persistently protect the basic right of women and children, especially female children. Government, lawmakers and policymakers should make law and policies to strictly prohibit any violence committed such as infanticide, sex-selected abortion etc. It is possible to eliminate the stereotype of son preference if governments, societies, schools etc. are proactive to combat it.","For most couples, they would like to have children; for most parents, they are child-centered and love their children more than themselves life.

Y,K3119,35758,gv7,Korean,Male,642,5,w,4642,1,847,840,840,"My father's generation in KOREA usually was a big family that consists of sisters and brothers more than 6 members. Surprisingly, the member of my father's brothers and sisters is 11. Moreover, surprising me is that my father was the 6th of the family member and he was the first son after my grandfather had 5 daughters. Even though there is an implicit and underlying reason, when I was kid, I didn't notice why my father has many brothers and sisters. I was just happy about the fact that I had many relatives who love me. Come to think of it now, the crucial reason why father had a big family is the preference for the male children. Although people's thinking about the preference for boys has been changed, still, many people sustain his mind to have a boy. So, I think that this misleading thought has several negative effects: imbalance sex ratio, selective abortion, discrimination against female, and crimes related to preference for boys.

 First of all, this dangerous and exorbitant thinking is normally based on our traditional idea that only males have enough ability that might support and bring on their family's prosperity. This traditional and fixed idea has maintained for many generations. So, I think that the preference for the boy causes an inevitable result that is imbalance sex ratio between female and male. For example, I read one article related to this. This article was reporting that within several years, male would outnumber female and then male would have a big problem that couldn't find proper their fiancé because of this erroneous preference for boys. Moreover, one apparent propensity among women is the fact they pursuit their goal. In other words, now that they don't think that they necessarily have to marry, this proclivity will makes it difficult to find their wives.

 Secondly, this preference might have a possibility to cause the intentional and selective abortion, due to the parents' eager desire for boys. Before I begin to describe this, I want to think about our wondrous and miraculous medical techniques that we have as an example. One of the representative medical devices is the ultrasound. This medical device is used not only to check the prenatal diagnosis, but also to distinguish between male and female. This earlier differentiation of gender leads to an unexpected side effect such as selective abortion. Although the selective abortion is legal in some countries, the most important thing that they overlook is the negligence for life. I think that we don't have right to deprive babies of their lives. In addition, the stronger the preference for boys is, the bigger the selective abortion will become. 

 Thirdly, what I conceive is the discrimination against women in their society. As an example, according to UNICEF, up to 50 million girls are missing from India's population due to the country's gender discrimination. As another example, Korean fixed ideas about women in the past exclude their social activities and put their duties on housekeeping such as house cleaning, cooking and taking care of their children. These outdated conceptions are based on the preference for boys, who support parents and carry on a family line. Even though the role of women in diverse and various fields has been growing, our society still retains many problems for women not to play a key role beyond a shadow of doubt. First of all, before their birth, the fact that female babies are not welcomed must be an implicit evidence of discrimination against women. 

 Finally, it might have a high incidence of crimes related to the gender discrimination. These crimes include an illegal surrogate mother, kidnapping of boys, and deliberate murder or abandonment of a young girl or infant. Of course, these ideas might be very extreme, but eventually these crimes occur around us. Especially, these crimes are very severe and prevalent in the poor countries and totally think little of respecting the life and human right. One of the most famous directors in Korea made a movie about a surrogate mother. This sad movie totally and perfectly dealt with the preference for boys and the miserable life of a woman who lived in the Dynasty ANON_NAME_0. Also, it is telling to us about the tragedy resulted from this preference.
 
 In conclusion, the preference of boys causes several negative effects including imbalance of sex ratio, selective abortion, gender discrimination, and a high incidence of crimes related to the preference for boys. This wrong conception triggers a series of events like chemical chain reaction and the negative results are closely related to each other. So, to prevent crimes, protect the preference for boys, and respect the women' right, first and foremost, the reform of our consciousness must be required and must be carried out. It can be done by the enlightenment of people and some useful programs that are leaded by government and professional groups.

I was surprised with the fact that my best friend, who is a prestigious neuroscience researcher in U.S, said me that he was hoping that his first child was a boy. I was shocked having heard that affirmation, since my friend is a quite liberated man who is living within the XXI century's standpoint. For he, who is a knower of American culture, it is easier to deal with the upbringing process of a boy instead of a girl. It is unbelievable how the fact that boys are preferred over girls is still conceived. It is said that women have gained access to many standards in our society, and this fact is easily verifiable with current statistics. Nevertheless, many future parents would prefer to have a male child arguing that a boy requires less educational effort, less problems in the adolescence years and more access to job opportunities. In the next paragraphs I will disclose why many parents justify each one of these arguments and I will show how these appreciations could have a profound impact in the demographic characteristics of our society.

First that all, it is appropriate to establish that the desire of many parents of having a boy is just a vague desire. It is essentially impossible to choose the sex of a child. The act of conception is a process that according to scientific knowledge is due to chance. Thus, having established this issue, we could just speculate about the results in the case that parents were able to decide the genre of their next generation. However, the perception that boys implies a better option compared with girls, deserves a wide discussion. 
 
In general, boys are considered less expensive than girls in terms of material needs. Early in the upbringing process, girls are always demanding expensive gifts. Expensive presents, which are desired for young girls, are more complex that boy's toys, which are mostly cars and superheroes. In the same way, in the teenage years, girls insist in expensive gifts such as cosmetic items and social compromises such as parties, trips, cruises. Most of these compromises are driven by social pressures. On contrast, males are by far less demanding. A soccer ball, a baseball bat or a collection of cars, is enough to get entertained and distracted as a young kid. In the teen years, boys acquire less social compromises and demand less care in terms of sexuality and behavior.

The preference for males instead of girls for many parents also is based upon facilities in the educational process. For some parents the upbringing process in girls could be challenging. Overall, girls assume a demarked role inside society. Although recently more and more young women are reaching the job market, family values and maternity are still desirable end points for each woman. However, many young women can find hard to engage with these classical values because they do consider them as inherent features of paternalist models. Furthermore, some parents consider that there is more pressure at the time of discussing sexual concerns with girls than with males. It is socially accepted nowadays the fact that women are in free to decide sexual preference and birth control methods. Having this fact in mind, many parents are afraid of this imminent discussion. 

Finally, despite of big efforts on improving jobs opportunities for women, there are still some limitations in job access to woman, even professional ones. This phenomenon is more remarkable in developing countries where feministic manifestations are more subtle. Thus, boys would have fewer problems when they face the challenging of accessing job markets. 

Surely, there are more reasons to support why some parents prefer boys instead girls. In some cultures like oriental ones, it is believed that boys are more able to support their parents when they get old. On the contrary, generally girls get married and they usually leave the familiar core. So girls are less able to support parents when they get elderly. At the end, all the reasons to support boys instead of girls converge in social or cultural fields. This fact might insinuate that most of these reasons are based mainly upon stereotypes instead of natural advantages. Demographically, the fact that more boys could surpass the number of girls is worrying. It might threaten the genetic diversity and increase the number of endogamous marriage. At least that explicit abortive maneuvers be taken against pregnant women carrying up a female fetus, it hardly would be real. Fortunately, nature is wise and knows why things happen.","I was surprised with the fact that my best friend, who is a prestigious neuroscience researcher in U.S, said me that he was hoping that his first child was a boy.

Demographically, the fact that more boys could surpass the number of girls is worrying. It might threaten the genetic diversity and increase the number of endogamous marriage. At least that explicit abortive maneuvers be taken against pregnant women carrying up a female fetus, it hardly would be real. Fortunately, nature is wise and knows why things happen.","I was surprised with the fact that my best friend, who is a prestigious neuroscience researcher in U.S, said me that he was hoping that his first child was a boy. I was shocked having heard that affirmation, since my friend is a quite liberated man who is living within the XXI century's standpoint. For he, who is a knower of American culture, it is easier to deal with the upbringing process of a boy instead of a girl. It is unbelievable how the fact that boys are preferred over girls is still conceived. It is said that women have gained access to many standards in our society, and this fact is easily verifiable with current statistics. Nevertheless, many future parents would prefer to have a male child arguing that a boy requires less educational effort, less problems in the adolescence years and more access to job opportunities. In the next paragraphs I will disclose why many parents justify each one of these arguments and I will show how these appreciations could have a profound impact in the demographic characteristics of our society. First that all, it is appropriate to establish that the desire of many parents of having a boy is just a vague desire. It is essentially impossible to choose the sex of a child. The act of conception is a process that according to scientific knowledge is due to chance. Thus, having established this issue, we could just speculate about the results in the case that parents were able to decide the genre of their next generation. However, the perception that boys implies a better option compared with girls, deserves a wide discussion. In general, boys are considered less expensive than girls in terms of material needs. Early in the upbringing process, girls are always demanding expensive gifts. Expensive presents, which are desired for young girls, are more complex that boy's toys, which are mostly cars and superheroes. In the same way, in the teenage years, girls insist in expensive gifts such as cosmetic items and social compromises such as parties, trips, cruises. Most of these compromises are driven by social pressures. On contrast, males are by far less demanding. A soccer ball, a baseball bat or a collection of cars, is enough to get entertained and distracted as a young kid. In the teen years, boys acquire less social compromises and demand less care in terms of sexuality and behavior. The preference for males instead of girls for many parents also is based upon facilities in the educational process. For some parents the upbringing process in girls could be challenging. Overall, girls assume a demarked role inside society. Although recently more and more young women are reaching the job market, family values and maternity are still desirable end points for each woman. However, many young women can find hard to engage with these classical values because they do consider them as inherent features of paternalist models. Furthermore, some parents consider that there is more pressure at the time of discussing sexual concerns with girls than with males. It is socially accepted nowadays the fact that women are in free to decide sexual preference and birth control methods. Having this fact in mind, many parents are afraid of this imminent discussion. Finally, despite of big efforts on improving jobs opportunities for women, there are still some limitations in job access to woman, even professional ones. This phenomenon is more remarkable in developing countries where feministic manifestations are more subtle. Thus, boys would have fewer problems when they face the challenging of accessing job markets. Surely, there are more reasons to support why some parents prefer boys instead girls. In some cultures like oriental ones, it is believed that boys are more able to support their parents when they get old. On the contrary, generally girls get married and they usually leave the familiar core. So girls are less able to support parents when they get elderly. At the end, all the reasons to support boys instead of girls converge in social or cultural fields. This fact might insinuate that most of these reasons are based mainly upon stereotypes instead of natural advantages. Demographically, the fact that more boys could surpass the number of girls is worrying. It might threaten the genetic diversity and increase the number of endogamous marriage. At least that explicit abortive maneuvers be taken against pregnant women carrying up a female fetus, it hardly would be real. Fortunately, nature is wise and knows why things happen.",2,
Y,S656,35753,df4,Spanish,Male,642,5,w,4642,1,492,492,492,"The percentage of women in the worldwide population is higher than the percentage of men. Everyday male babies are born more than female babies. However, the statistics indicate that at the adult age the percentage of women increase more than the percentage of men. Historically, men have had that go to war to defend their nation and many men die while women stay at home taking care of their children but women have had more disadvantages than men. Many people have considered this feminine gender as weak gender and men for this reason have obtained many positions. However, recently women have taken many jobs. One of these underlying reasons is because there are much offer but few men that could occupy these positions. Therefore, most of parts of the world, many parents prefer to have boys than girls. There are three reasons that can explain this preference of parents such as opportunities of job, participation of wars, and inheritance of the last names. Men have more opportunities than women and many parents base on this reason to argue their preferences.

Probably, many parents think that boys have more opportunities than girls because our society sustains ancestral ideas that consist in supporting more men easily than women. For example, many employers prefer to work with men than women, since many of these works women are not capable of lifting heavy materials and many of these jobs requires physical resistance. Moreover, men do not need maternity permission so that this is an advantage for the employers to have male stuff.


Historically, men have been going to wars and for many families the patriotism is a pride. For instance, many American families consider that going to the war would be an honor for them, because they have these patriotic feeling. They believe that the military service is an excellent opportunity to be included in the history of their countries and to go to war they could defend the future of their children.

Basically, the last names of families depend on their inheritance. Most of these countries in the world, only boys can keep the last name of their family. The majority of the last names of women are replaced when they get married or when they have children because in many parts of the world the last name of children come from their fathers. Additionally, many families consider that is important to preserve the last name since areas such as politic is very important the last name, specially if in these family one of these members has been a person very famous in the politic life.

In conclusion, boys have more advantages than girls in our society in many aspects, such as to get more opportunities of job, to go to the war, and to keep the family last name. Therefore, many parents prefer boys than girls, even though they know that men take more risks than women when they must participate in wars.

My uncles used to make jokes about my father because he only had daughters. Even that my father's brothers are professional and like to say that they are open mind, they teased him every time they could. I perfectly remember one time: I was 8 years old and my uncle said that children with a hole (referring to the vagina) usually give a lot of problems to their parents. I was not conscious about concepts as discrimination, inequity or unfairness, but I was so mad about the comment. The only answer that came to my mind was ""It's better a hole than a stick"". Everybody blushed. Ironically, they blushed because I was saying those things, and not because my uncle's words.

Some cultures are more honest in their preference for boys; some others, on the contrary, have the same predilection but they try to hide it. All this inclinations are based on stereotypes that cultures have built through the years (sometimes centuries), and remain valid because they are transmitted through generations. This preference generates three main effects: diminish women self steem, overestimate men role, and could unbalance the population (male-female) in a country. In this essay I aim to describe this consequences.

The first consequence of this preference is that diminish women self steem. Knowing that your father was excepting a boy instead of you, that a lot of blue clothes were wasted for ""your fault"" and that your grandmother looks very sad at your newborn picture, can give you a lot of erroneous feeling, but it never will brings you confidence. The discovering of this preference --since she is a kid-- makes a woman believes that she is emotional and physically weaker than a man; that she (because her gender) is difficult to raise: that she can be the shame of the family if is pregnant before marriage, and that she can't carry on the family in case is needed. This no only affects the adulthood of many women, but the development of societies too. Furthermore, many times is expected that girls play the role of the boy that never born and this ends in frustration and pain.


The second consequence of this preference is that it overestimate the role of men and put on them a lot of pressure. A boy listen his parents conversations and see himself as a blessing in his family, with an particular mission in life. On one hand, this preference makes men believe that they are better than woman. On the other hand put a lot of pressure on them reinforcing the idea that they only can play certain roles in societies. The gender role creates stereotypes as ""a man must provide the basic needs of a family"" and ""a man can not do certain things, as take care of children or cook"". My nephew, for example, asked a kitchen set to Santa Claus and the ""machista Santa Claus"" brought him a robots set. That was just a game, but illustrates the frustration that a preconception of a gender role can bring. Furthermore, this example illustrates that men's abilities and interest can be killed since they know that their parents preferred them to accomplish specific goals..

The third consequence of the preference on boys is that can unbalance the population of woman and man in countries where a real selection is done. In China, for example, many women abort their girl babies because they are expecting to have a boy. My friend ANON_NAME_0 ANON_NAME_0, from China, was telling me that because of this, China has more men than women and for some men is difficult to find a wife. This can affect reproduction and, furthermore, a society development. 

In conclusion, the preference on boys can bring intangible consequences, and tangible ones (as the case of China). Diminish women self-steem and overestimate men role can affect social, economical and political spheres. To selection the gender of a baby, trough abortion, can unbalance countries and affects its develo","My uncles used to make jokes about my father because he only had daughters.

The movie and the way it was presented made it seem like another Hollywood movie that was more about the cast and budget rather than the quality of the movie. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised by the film.
 The film is about people with the ability to retrieve information from one's dream or plant an idea in the subconscious. In the movie, the main character, Leonardo DiCaprio, tries to overcome his grief from losing his wife while attempting a dangerous task of planting an idea in a person's subconscious. The film also explores the idea of dream versus reality and how people can lose track of dream or reality. The reason I like this film was the engaging debate with friends after watching the film. The film was filmed in a way where possibilities existed not limited only to the ending of the film itself but the audience's imagination.","One of the most fascinating movies I have seen is Inception, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

 When I moved into the apartment, I couldn't help complaining ""My goodness! 

What a mess!"". Therefore, I teamed up with my cousin to straighten the room 

up and move some furniture around. Now, it looks neat and spacious. For me, 

the room is the place where I can relax and I feel comfortable. In my free 

time, I like to turn my computer on, put my earphone on, pick some music out 

on Youtube, it cheers me up all the time. In addition, my room is bright. All 

I need to do is take the curtain down and let in the sunlight, so I don't 

turn light on in the daytime.
 

 The problem in my apartment is the location is close to the main street, 

so it makes me feel noisy sometimes. At midnight, I can hear ambulance pass 

by and people shout or yell with excitement. I am trying to figure out how to 

improve this situation.
 

 To make the room feel like home, I think I will pick carpets, bonsai and 

pictures up to decorate my room. Hang the pictures on, put the carpets on the 

floor, and then set the bonsai on the table. If I change it a little, the 

room would be very different.

Fortunately, I have a best friend who can congratulate me on my success. 

 Arim is my best friend whom I met in church in 2002. When I met her at the first time, she looks sensitive and unfriendly. However, I realized I completely misunderstood her personalities. She is very friendly and nice. Also she is the person that has taken care of people who needs help. For example, when I got a job in my country 4 years ago Arim was really happy and she truly congratulated me on getting job like her own business. I was so impressed at that time. As a result, our friendship is keeping up until now and she is still my best friend ever.

However, I realized I completely misunderstood her personalities. She is very friendly and nice. Also she is the person that has taken care of people who needs help.

We couldn't stop talking even it was 11:00pm. He always knows what I am thinking about or I want. I still remember two years ago, when my ex-boyfriend broke up with me, he asked me to do something to forget the bad thing, and he was with me everyday. He told me, if I felt sad or unhappy, I would tell him, he can solve the problem. Although I am in the U.S, where is very far from Taiwan, he still call me every week, I also have a lot of interesting things want to tell him. He is a friend who really close my life and heart.",2,Describe friend

We like to do lots of things together like watching movies and having delicious food. I really love to talk the story that I have experienced in this country to her. From time to time, I really miss her, who has a number of same memories with me. I prefer having conversations with her through the Skype, which is a service to call to a foreign country for free. One of my hopes is that she travels to the US to see me; however, it's not easy to do because of a expensive flight ticket. I want to make friends who have lots of things in common with me in this country.

Last week, she introduced me some of her friends, who are very nice. These friends, whose major is fashion design too, are from France and Italy. It was a beautiful experience because I learned some words in new languages, which are french and italian.
