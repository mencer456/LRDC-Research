My parents are very good example to show me how to be ideal parents. My father, who always brings me much joy and laugh, influences me deeply. He is very optimistic and funny. He is a very strict manager in his company, but he is never stringent to me because he thinks my mother is strict enough. He gives me a lot of freedom. My mother is a person who is very kind and graceful. She never has big problems with other people around her. Since I was very young, she has taught me to respect the elder, so that, when I eat something, I always ask my grandparents first if they want to eat. My mother teaches me many things that can help improve my personal quality, such as perseverance, courtesy, honesty and tolerance. She is not only my mother but also my best teacher. Anyway, in the future I want to be a mother like my mother and I want to find a husband whose personality is similar to my father's.
